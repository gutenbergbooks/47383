<h3>ESSAY ON SATIRE:<br />

ADDRESSED TO<br />

THE RIGHT HONOURABLE<br />

CHARLES,<br />

EARL OF DORSET AND MIDDLESEX,<br />

LORD CHAMBERLAIN OF HIS
MAJESTY'S HOUSEHOLD, KNIGHT OF THE MOST NOBLE
ORDER OF THE GARTER, &amp;C.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h3>


<p>
MY LORD,<br />
</p>

<p>The wishes and desires of all good men, which
have attended your lordship from your first appearance
in the world, are at length accomplished, from
your obtaining those honours and dignities which
you have so long deserved. There are no factions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
though irreconcileable to one another, that are not
united in their affection to you, and the respect they
pay you. They are equally pleased in your prosperity,
and would be equally concerned in your afflictions.
Titus Vespasian was not more the delight of human
kind. The universal empire made him only more
known, and more powerful, but could not make him
more beloved. He had greater ability of doing good,
but your inclination to it is not less; and though you
could not extend your beneficence to so many persons,
yet you have lost as few days as that excellent
emperor; and never had his complaint to make when
you went to bed, that the sun had shone upon you
in vain, when you had the opportunity of relieving
some unhappy man. This, my lord, has justly acquired
you as many friends as there are persons who
have the honour to be known to you. Mere acquaintance
you have none; you have drawn them
all into a nearer line; and they who have conversed
with you are for ever after inviolably yours.
This is a truth so generally acknowledged, that it
needs no proof: it is of the nature of a first principle,
which is received as soon as it is proposed; and
needs not the reformation which Descartes used to
his; for we doubt not, neither can we properly say,
we think we admire and love you above all other
men; there is a certainty in the proposition, and
we know it. With the same assurance I can say,
you neither have enemies, nor can scarce have any;
for they who have never heard of you, can neither
love or hate you; and they who have, can have no
other notion of you, than that which they receive
from the public, that you are the best of men. After
this, my testimony can be of no farther use, than
to declare it to be day-light at high-noon; and all
who have the benefit of sight, can look up as well,
and see the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>It is true, I have one privilege which is almost
particular to myself, that I saw you in the east at
your first arising above the hemisphere: I was as
soon sensible as any man of that light, when it was
but just shooting out, and beginning to travel upwards
to the meridian. I made my early addresses
to your lordship, in my "Essay of Dramatic Poetry;"
and therein bespoke you to the world, wherein
I have the right of a first discoverer.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> When I
was myself in the rudiments of my poetry, without
name or reputation in the world, having rather the
ambition of a writer, than the skill; when I was
drawing the outlines of an art, without any living
master to instruct me in it; an art which had been
better praised than studied here in England, wherein
Shakespeare, who created the stage among us, had
rather written happily, than knowingly and justly,
and Jonson, who, by studying Horace, had been
acquainted with the rules, yet seemed to envy to posterity
that knowledge, and, like an inventor of some
useful art, to make a monopoly of his learning;
when thus, as I may say, before the use of the load-stone,
or knowledge of the compass, I was sailing
in a vast ocean, without other help than the pole-star
of the ancients, and the rules of the French
stage amongst the moderns, which are extremely
different from ours, by reason of their opposite taste;
yet even then, I had the presumption to dedicate
to your lordship&mdash;a very unfinished piece, I must
confess, and which only can be excused by the little
experience of the author, and the modesty of
the title&mdash;"An Essay." Yet I was stronger in prophecy
than I was in criticism; I was inspired to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
foretell you to mankind, as the restorer of poetry,
the greatest genius, the truest judge, and the best
patron.</p>

<p>Good sense and good nature are never separated,
though the ignorant world has thought otherwise.
Good nature, by which I mean beneficence and
candour, is the product of right reason; which of necessity
will give allowance to the failings of others,
by considering that there is nothing perfect in mankind;
and by distinguishing that which comes nearest
to excellency, though not absolutely free from
faults, will certainly produce a candour in the judge.
It is incident to an elevated understanding, like
your lordship's, to find out the errors of other men;
but it is your prerogative to pardon them; to look
with pleasure on those things, which are somewhat
congenial, and of a remote kindred to your own
conceptions; and to forgive the many failings of
those, who, with their wretched art, cannot arrive
to those heights that you possess, from a happy,
abundant, and native genius: which are as inborn
to you, as they were to Shakespeare; and, for aught
I know, to Homer; in either of whom we find all
arts and sciences, all moral and natural philosophy,
without knowing that they ever studied them.</p>

<p>There is not an English writer this day living,
who is not perfectly convinced, that your lordship
excels all others in all the several parts of poetry
which you have undertaken to adorn. The most
vain, and the most ambitious of our age, have not
dared to assume so much, as the competitors of
Themistocles: they have yielded the first place without
dispute; and have been arrogantly content to
be esteemed as second to your lordship; and even
that also, with a <i>longo, sed proximi intervallo</i>. If
there have been, or are any, who go farther in their
self-conceit, they must be very singular in their opi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>nion;
they must be like the officer in a play, who
was called Captain, Lieutenant, and Company. The
world will easily conclude, whether such unattended
generals can ever be capable of making a revolution
in Parnassus.</p>

<p>I will not attempt, in this place, to say any thing
particular of your Lyric Poems, though they are the
delight and wonder of this age, and will be the envy
of the next.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The subject of this book confines
me to satire; and in that, an author of your own
quality, (whose ashes I will not disturb,) has given
you all the commendation which his self-sufficiency
could afford to any man: "The best good man, with
the worst-natured muse."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In that character, methinks,
I am reading Jonson's verses to the memory
of Shakespeare; an insolent, sparing, and invidious
panegyric: where good nature, the most godlike
commendation of a man, is only attributed to your
person, and denied to your writings; for they are
every where so full of candour, that, like Horace,
you only expose the follies of men, without arraigning
their vices; and in this excel him, that you add
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>that pointedness of thought, which is visibly wanting
in our great Roman. There is more of salt in
all your verses, than I have seen in any of the moderns,
or even of the ancients; but you have been
sparing of the gall, by which means you have pleased
all readers, and offended none. Donne alone, of
all our countrymen, had your talent; but was not
happy enough to arrive at your versification; and
were he translated into numbers, and English, he
would yet be wanting in the dignity of expression.
That which is the prime virtue, and chief ornament,
of Virgil, which distinguishes him from the rest of
writers, is so conspicuous in your verses, that it
casts a shadow on all your contemporaries; we cannot
be seen, or but obscurely, while you are present.
You equal Donne in the variety, multiplicity,
and choice of thoughts; you excel him in the
manner and the words. I read you both with the
same admiration, but not with the same delight. He
affects the metaphysics, not only in his satires, but
in his amorous verses, where nature only should
reign; and perplexes the minds of the fair sex with
nice speculations of philosophy, when he should engage
their hearts, and entertain them with the softnesses
of love. In this (if I may be pardoned for so
bold a truth) Mr Cowley has copied him to a fault;
so great a one, in my opinion, that it throws his
Mistress infinitely below his Pindarics, and his latter
compositions, which are undoubtedly the best of
his poems, and the most correct. For my own
part, I must avow it freely to the world, that I never
attempted any thing in satire, wherein I have
not studied your writings as the most perfect model.
I have continually laid them before me; and
the greatest commendation, which my own partiality
can give to my productions, is, that they are
copies, and no farther to be allowed, than as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
have something more or less of the original. Some
few touches of your lordship, some secret graces
which I have endeavoured to express after your
manner, have made whole poems of mine to pass
with approbation; but take your verses altogether,
and they are inimitable. If therefore I have not
written better, it is because you have not written
more. You have not set me sufficient copy to
transcribe; and I cannot add one letter of my own
invention, of which I have not the example there.</p>

<p>It is a general complaint against your lordship,
and I must have leave to upbraid you with it, that,
because you need not write, you will not. Mankind,
that wishes you so well in all things that relate
to your prosperity, have their intervals of wishing
for themselves, and are within a little of grudging
you the fulness of your fortune: they would
be more malicious if you used it not so well, and
with so much generosity.</p>

<p>Fame is in itself a real good, if we may believe
Cicero, who was perhaps too fond of it; but even
fame, as Virgil tells us, acquires strength by going
forward. Let Epicurus give indolency as an attribute
to his gods, and place in it the happiness of
the blest; the divinity which we worship has given
us not only a precept against it, but his own example
to the contrary. The world, my lord, would
be content to allow you a seventh day for rest; or
if you thought that hard upon you, we would not
refuse you half your time: if you came out, like
some great monarch, to take a town but once a
year, as it were for your diversion, though you had
no need to extend your territories. In short, if you
were a bad, or, which is worse, an indifferent poet,
we would thank you for our own quiet, and not expose
you to the want of yours. But when you are
so great and so successful, and when we have that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
necessity of your writing, that we cannot subsist
entirely without it, any more (I may almost say)
than the world without the daily course of ordinary
providence, methinks this argument might prevail
with you, my lord, to forego a little of your repose
for the public benefit. It is not that you are under
any force of working daily miracles, to prove
your being; but now and then somewhat of extraordinary,
that is, any thing of your production, is
requisite to refresh your character.</p>

<p>This, I think, my lord, is a sufficient reproach to
you; and should I carry it as far as mankind would
authorise me, would be little less than satire. And,
indeed, a provocation is almost necessary, in behalf
of the world, that you might be induced sometimes
to write; and in relation to a multitude of scribblers,
who daily pester the world with their insufferable
stuff, that they might be discouraged from writing
any more. I complain not of their lampoons and
libels, though I have been the public mark for many
years. I am vindictive enough to have repelled
force by force, if I could imagine that any of them
had ever reached me; but they either shot at rovers,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
and therefore missed, or their powder was so
weak, that I might safely stand them, at the nearest
distance. I answered not the "Rehearsal," because
I knew the author sat to himself when he drew the
picture, and was the very Bayes of his own farce:
because also I knew, that my betters<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> were more
concerned than I was in that satire: and, lastly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>because Mr Smith and Mr Johnson, the main pillars
of it, were two such languishing gentlemen in their
conversation, that I could liken them to nothing
but to their own relations, those noble characters of
men of wit and pleasure about the town. The like
considerations have hindered me from dealing with
the lamentable companions of their prose and doggrel.
I am so far from defending my poetry against
them, that I will not so much as expose theirs.
And for my morals, if they are not proof against
their attacks, let me be thought by posterity, what
those authors would be thought, if any memory of
them, or of their writings, could endure so long as
to another age. But these dull makers of lampoons,
as harmless as they have been to me, are yet
of dangerous example to the public. Some witty
men may perhaps succeed to their designs, and,
mixing sense with malice, blast the reputation of
the most innocent amongst men, and the most virtuous
amongst women.</p>

<p>Heaven be praised, our common libellers are as
free from the imputation of wit as of morality;
and therefore whatever mischief they have designed,
they have performed but little of it. Yet these
ill writers, in all justice, ought themselves to be exposed;
as Persius has given us a fair example in his
first satire, which is levelled particularly at them;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
and none is so fit to correct their faults, as he who
is not only clear from any in his own writings, but
is also so just, that he will never defame the good;
and is armed with the power of verse, to punish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and make examples of the bad. But of this I shall
have occasion to speak further, when I come to
give the definition and character of true satires.</p>

<p>In the mean time, as a counsellor bred up in the
knowledge of the municipal and statute laws, may
honestly inform a just prince how far his prerogative
extends; so I may be allowed to tell your lordship,
who, by an undisputed title, are the king of
poets, what an extent of power you have, and how
lawfully you may exercise it, over the petulant
scribblers of this age. As lord chamberlain, I know,
you are absolute by your office, in all that belongs
to the decency and good manners of the stage.
You can banish from thence scurrility and profaneness,
and restrain the licentious insolence of
poets, and their actors, in all things that shock the
public quiet, or the reputation of private persons,
under the notion of humour. But I mean not the
authority, which is annexed to your office; I speak
of that only which is inborn and inherent to your person;
what is produced in you by an excellent wit,
a masterly and commanding genius over all writers:
whereby you are empowered, when you please, to
give the final decision of wit; to put your stamp
on all that ought to pass for current; and set a
brand of reprobation on clipped poetry, and false coin.
A shilling dipped in the Bath may go for gold amongst
the ignorant, but the sceptres on the guineas show
the difference.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> That your lordship is formed by
nature for this supremacy, I could easily prove,
(were it not already granted by the world,) from
the distinguishing character of your writing: which
is so visible to me, that I never could be imposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
on to receive for yours, what was written by any
others; or to mistake your genuine poetry for their
spurious productions. I can farther add, with truth,
(though not without some vanity in saying it,) that
in the same paper, written by divers hands, whereof
your lordship's was only part, I could separate your
gold from their copper; and though I could not give
back to every author his own brass, (for there is not
the same rule for distinguishing betwixt bad and
bad, as betwixt ill and excellently good,) yet I never
failed of knowing what was yours, and what
was not; and was absolutely certain, that this, or
the other part, was positively yours, and could not
possibly be written by any other.</p>

<p>True it is, that some bad poems, though not all,
carry their owners' marks about them. There is
some peculiar awkwardness, false grammar, imperfect
sense, or, at the least, obscurity; some brand
or other on this buttock, or that ear, that it is notorious
who are the owners of the cattle, though they
should not sign it with their names. But your lordship,
on the contrary, is distinguished, not only by
the excellency of your thoughts, but by your style
and manner of expressing them. A painter, judging
of some admirable piece, may affirm, with certainty,
that it was of Holbein, or Vandyck; but
vulgar designs, and common draughts, are easily
mistaken, and misapplied. Thus, by my long study
of your lordship, I am arrived at the knowledge of
your particular manner. In the good poems of
other men, like those artists, I can only say, this is
like the draught of such a one, or like the colouring
of another. In short, I can only be sure, that
it is the hand of a good master; but in your performances,
it is scarcely possible for me to be deceived.
If you write in your strength, you stand
revealed at the first view; and should you write
under it, you cannot avoid some peculiar graces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
which only cost me a second consideration to discover
you: for I may say it, with all the severity
of truth, that every line of yours is precious. Your
lordship's only fault is, that you have not written
more; unless I could add another, and that yet
greater, but I fear for the public the accusation
would not be true,&mdash;that you have written, and out
of a vicious modesty will not publish.</p>

<p>Virgil has confined his works within the compass
of eighteen thousand lines, and has not treated
many subjects; yet he ever had, and ever will have,
the reputation of the best poet. Martial says of
him, that he could have excelled Varius in tragedy,
and Horace in lyric poetry, but out of deference to
his friends, he attempted neither.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The same prevalence of genius is in your lordship,
but the world cannot pardon your concealing
it on the same consideration; because we have neither
a living Varius, nor a Horace, in whose excellencies,
both of poems, odes, and satires, you had
equalled them, if our language had not yielded to
the Roman majesty, and length of time had not added
a reverence to the works of Horace. For good
sense is the same in all or most ages; and course
of time rather improves nature, than impairs her.
What has been, may be again: another Homer, and
another Virgil, may possibly arise from those very
causes which produced the first; though it would
be impudence to affirm, that any such have yet appeared.</p>

<p>It is manifest, that some particular ages have
been more happy than others in the production of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
great men, in all sorts of arts and sciences; as that
of Euripides, Sophocles, Aristophanes, and the rest,
for stage poetry amongst the Greeks; that of Augustus,
for heroic, lyric, dramatic, elegiac, and indeed
all sorts of poetry, in the persons of Virgil,
Horace, Varius, Ovid, and many others; especially
if we take into that century the latter end of the
commonwealth, wherein we find Varo, Lucretius,
and Catullus; and at the same time lived Cicero,
and Sallust, and C&aelig;sar. A famous age in modern
times, for learning in every kind, was that of Lorenzo
de Medici, and his son Leo the Tenth; wherein
painting was revived, and poetry flourished, and
the Greek language was restored.</p>

<p>Examples in all these are obvious: but what I
would infer is this; that in such an age, it is possible
some great genius may arise, to equal any of the
ancients; abating only for the language. For great
contemporaries whet and cultivate each other; and
mutual borrowing, and commerce, makes the common
riches of learning, as it does of the civil government.</p>

<p>But suppose that Homer and Virgil were the only
of their species, and that nature was so much worn
out in producing them, that she is never able to
bear the like again, yet the example only holds in
heroic poetry: in tragedy and satire, I offer myself
to maintain against some of our modern critics, that
this age and the last, particularly in England, have
excelled the ancients in both those kinds; and I
would instance in Shakespeare of the former, of
your lordship in the latter sort.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus I might safely confine myself to my native
country; but if I would only cross the seas, I might
find in France a living Horace and a Juvenal, in the
person of the admirable Boileau; whose numbers
are excellent, whose expressions are noble, whose
thoughts are just, whose language is pure, whose
satire is pointed, and whose sense is close; what he
borrows from the ancients, he repays with usury of
his own, in coin as good, and almost as universally
valuable: for, setting prejudice and partiality apart,
though he is our enemy, the stamp of a Louis, the
patron of all arts, is not much inferior to the medal
of an Augustus C&aelig;sar. Let this be said without
entering into the interests of factions and parties,
and relating only to the bounty of that king to men
of learning and merit; a praise so just, that even
we, who are his enemies, cannot refuse it to him.</p>

<p>Now if it may be permitted me to go back again to
the consideration of epic poetry, I have confessed,
that no man hitherto has reached, or so much as approached,
to the excellencies of Homer, or of Virgil;
I must farther add, that Statius, the best versificator
next to Virgil, knew not how to design after
him, though he had the model in his eye; that
Lucan is wanting both in design and subject, and
is besides too full of heat and affectation; that
amongst the moderns, Ariosto neither designed justly,
nor observed any unity of action, or compass of
time, or moderation in the vastness of his draught:
his style is luxurious, without majesty or decency,
and his adventures without the compass of nature
and possibility. Tasso, whose design was regular,
and who observed the rules of unity in time and
place more closely than Virgil, yet was not so
happy in his action; he confesses himself to have
been too lyrical, that is, to have written beneath
the dignity of heroic verse, in his Episodes of Sophronia,
Erminia, and Armida. His story is not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
pleasing as Ariosto's; he is too flatulent sometimes,
and sometimes too dry; many times unequal, and
almost always forced; and, besides, is full of conceipts,
points of epigram, and witticisms; all which
are not only below the dignity of heroic verse, but
contrary to its nature: Virgil and Homer have not
one of them. And those who are guilty of so boyish
an ambition in so grave a subject, are so far from
being considered as heroic poets, that they ought
to be turned down from Homer to the Anthologia,
from Virgil to Martial and Owen's Epigrams, and
from Spenser to Flecno; that is, from the top to
the bottom of all poetry. But to return to Tasso:
he borrows from the invention of Boiardo, and in
his alteration of his poem, which is infinitely for the
worse, imitates Homer so very servilely, that (for
example) he gives the king of Jerusalem fifty sons,
only because Homer had bestowed the like number
on king Priam; he kills the youngest in the same
manner, and has provided his hero with a Patroclus,
under another name, only to bring him back
to the wars, when his friend was killed.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The French
have performed nothing in this kind which is not
far below those two Italians, and subject to a thousand
more reflections, without examining their St
Lewis, their Pucelle, or their Alarique.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The English
have only to boast of Spenser and Milton, who
neither of them wanted either genius or learning
to have been perfect poets, and yet both of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>are liable to many censures. For there is no uniformity
in the design of Spenser: he aims at the
accomplishment of no one action; he raises up a
hero for every one of his adventures; and endows
each of them with some particular moral virtue,
which renders them all equal, without subordination,
or preference. Every one is most valiant in
his own legend: only we must do him that justice
to observe, that magnanimity, which is the character
of Prince Arthur, shines throughout the whole
poem; and succours the rest, when they are in distress.
The original of every knight was then living
in the court of Queen Elizabeth; and he attributed
to each of them that virtue, which he thought was
most conspicuous in them; an ingenious piece of
flattery, though it turned not much to his account.
Had he lived to finish his poem, in the six remaining
legends, it had certainly been more of a piece;
but could not have been perfect, because the model
was not true. But Prince Arthur, or his chief patron
Sir Philip Sydney, whom he intended to make
happy by the marriage of his Gloriana, dying before
him, deprived the poet both of means and spirit
to accomplish his design.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> For the rest, his obsolete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
language,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and the ill choice of his stanza, are
faults but of the second magnitude; for, notwithstanding
the first, he is still intelligible, at least
after a little practice; and for the last, he is the
more to be admired, that, labouring under such a
difficulty, his verses are so numerous, so various,
and so harmonious, that only Virgil, whom he professedly
imitated, has surpassed him among the
Romans; and only Mr Waller among the English.</p>

<p>As for Mr Milton, whom we all admire with so
much justice, his subject is not that of an heroic
poem, properly so called. His design is the losing
of our happiness; his event is not prosperous, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
that of all other epic works; his heavenly machines
are many, and his human persons are but two. But I
will not take Mr Rymer's work out of his hands:
he has promised the world a critique on that author;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
wherein, though he will not allow his poem for
heroic, I hope he will grant us, that his thoughts
are elevated, his words sounding, and that no man
has so happily copied the manner of Homer, or so
copiously translated his Grecisms, and the Latin
elegancies of Virgil. It is true, he runs into a flat
of thought, sometimes for a hundred lines together,
but it is when he has got into a track of scripture.
His antiquated words were his choice, not his necessity;
for therein he imitated Spenser, as Spenser
did Chaucer. And though, perhaps, the love of
their masters may have transported both too far,
in the frequent use of them, yet, in my opinion,
obsolete words may then be laudably revived, when
either they are more sounding, or more significant,
than those in practice; and when their obscurity is
taken away, by joining other words to them, which
clear the sense; according to the rule of Horace,
for the admission of new words.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But in both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>cases a moderation is to be observed in the use of
them: for unnecessary coinage, as well as unnecessary
revival, runs into affectation; a fault to be
avoided on either hand. Neither will I justify
Milton for his blank verse, though I may excuse
him, by the example of Hannibal Caro, and other
Italians, who have used it; for whatever causes he
alleges for the abolishing of rhyme, (which I have
not now the leisure to examine,) his own particular
reason is plainly this, that rhyme was not his talent;
he had neither the ease of doing it, nor the graces
of it; which is manifest in his "Juvenilia," or verses
written in his youth, where his rhyme is always
constrained and forced, and comes hardly from
him, at an age when the soul is most pliant, and the
passion of love makes almost every man a rhymer,
though not a poet.</p>

<p>By this time, my lord, I doubt not but that you
wonder, why I have run off from my bias so long
together, and made so tedious a digression from
satire to heroic poetry. But if you will not excuse
it, by the tattling quality of age, which, as Sir
William D'Avenant says, is always narrative, yet I
hope the usefulness of what I have to say on this
subject will qualify the remoteness of it; and this
is the last time I will commit the crime of prefaces,
or trouble the world with my notions of any thing
that relates to verse.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> I have then, as you see, observed
the failings of many great wits amongst the
moderns, who have attempted to write an epic
poem. Besides these, or the like animadversions of
them by other men, there is yet a farther reason
given, why they cannot possibly succeed so well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
as the ancients, even though we could allow them
not to be inferior, either in genius or learning, or
the tongue in which they write, or all those other
wonderful qualifications which are necessary to the
forming of a true accomplished heroic poet. The
fault is laid on our religion; they say, that Christianity
is not capable of those embellishments
which are afforded in the belief of those ancient
heathens.</p>

<p>And it is true, that, in the severe notions of our
faith, the fortitude of a Christian consists in patience,
and suffering, for the love of God, whatever
hardships can befall in the world; not in any great
attempts, or in performance of those enterprizes
which the poets call heroic, and which are commonly
the effects of interest, ostentation, pride,
and worldly honour: that humility and resignation
are our prime virtues; and that these include
no action, but that of the soul; when as, on the
contrary, an heroic poem requires to its necessary
design, and as its last perfection, some great action
of war, the accomplishment of some extraordinary
undertaking; which requires the strength and vigour
of the body, the duty of a soldier, the capacity
and prudence of a general, and, in short, as much,
or more, of the active virtue, than the suffering.
But to this the answer is very obvious. God has
placed us in our several stations; the virtues of a
private Christian are patience, obedience, submission,
and the like; but those of a magistrate, or
general, or a king, are prudence, counsel, active
fortitude, coercive power, awful command, and the
exercise of magnanimity, as well as justice. So
that this objection hinders not, but that an epic
poem, or the heroic action of some great commander,
enterprized for the common good, and honour
of the Christian cause, and executed happily, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
be as well written now, as it was of old by the
heathens; provided the poet be endued with the
same talents; and the language, though not of
equal dignity, yet as near approaching to it, as our
modern barbarism will allow; which is all that can
be expected from our own, or any other now extant,
though more refined; and therefore we are to
rest contented with that only inferiority, which is
not possibly to be remedied.</p>

<p>I wish I could as easily remove that other difficulty
which yet remains. It is objected by a great French
critic, as well as an admirable poet, yet living, and
whom I have mentioned with that honour which
his merit exacts from me, I mean Boileau, that
the machines of our Christian religion, in heroic
poetry, are much more feeble to support that weight
than those of heathenism. Their doctrine, grounded
as it was on ridiculous fables, was yet the belief
of the two victorious monarchies, the Grecian and
Roman. Their gods did not only interest themselves
in the event of wars, (which is the effect of a
superior providence,) but also espoused the several
parties, in a visible corporeal descent, managed their
intrigues, and fought their battles sometimes in opposition
to each other: though Virgil (more discreet
than Homer in that last particular) has contented
himself with the partiality of his deities,
their favours, their counsels or commands, to those
whose cause they had espoused, without bringing
them to the outrageousness of blows. Now, our
religion (says he) is deprived of the greatest part of
those machines; at least the most shining in epic
poetry. Though St Michael, in Ariosto, seeks out
Discord, to send her among the Pagans, and finds
her in a convent of friars, where peace should reign,
which indeed is fine satire; and Satan, in Tasso, ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>cites
Solyman to an attempt by night on the Christian
camp, and brings an host of devils to his assistance;
yet the archangel, in the former example,
when Discord was restive, and would not be drawn
from her beloved monastery with fair words, has
the whip-hand of her, drags her out with many
stripes, sets her, on God's name, about her business,
and makes her know the difference of strength betwixt
a nuncio of heaven, and a minister of hell.
The same angel, in the latter instance from Tasso,
(as if God had never another messenger belonging
to the court, but was confined like Jupiter to Mercury,
and Juno to Iris,) when he sees his time, that
is, when half of the Christians are already killed,
and all the rest are in a fair way to be routed,
stickles betwixt the remainders of God's host, and
the race of fiends; pulls the devils backward by
the tails, and drives them from their quarry; or
otherwise the whole business had miscarried, and
Jerusalem remained untaken. This, says Boileau,
is a very unequal match for the poor devils, who
are sure to come by the worst of it in the combat;
for nothing is more easy, than for an Almighty
Power to bring his old rebels to reason, when he
pleases. Consequently, what pleasure, what entertainment,
can be raised from so pitiful a machine,
where we see the success of the battle from the
very beginning of it; unless that, as we are Christians,
we are glad that we have gotten God on our
side, to maul our enemies, when we cannot do the
work ourselves? For, if the poet had given the
faithful more courage, which had cost him nothing,
or at least have made them exceed the Turks in
number, he might have gained the victory for
us Christians, without interesting heaven in the
quarrel, and that with as much ease, and as little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
credit to the conqueror, as when a party of a
hundred soldiers defeats another which consists
only of fifty.</p>

<p>This, my lord, I confess, is such an argument
against our modern poetry, as cannot be answered
by those mediums which have been used. We
cannot hitherto boast, that our religion has furnished
us with any such machines, as have made
the strength and beauty of the ancient buildings.</p>

<p>But what if I venture to advance an invention of
my own, to supply the manifest defect of our new
writers? I am sufficiently sensible of my weakness;
and it is not very probable that I should succeed in
such a project, whereof I have not had the least
hint from any of my predecessors, the poets, or any
of their seconds and coadjutors, the critics. Yet
we see the art of war is improved in sieges, and
new instruments of death are invented daily;
something new in philosophy, and the mechanics,
is discovered almost every year; and the science of
former ages is improved by the succeeding. I will
not detain you with a long preamble to that, which
better judges will, perhaps, conclude to be little
worth.</p>

<p>It is this, in short&mdash;that Christian poets have not
hitherto been acquainted with their own strength.
If they had searched the Old Testament as they
ought, they might there have found the machines
which are proper for their work; and those more
certain in their effect, than it may be the New Testament
is, in the rules sufficient for salvation. The
perusing of one chapter in the prophecy of Daniel,
and accommodating what there they find with the
principles of Platonic philosophy, as it is now christianized,
would have made the ministry of angels as
strong an engine, for the working up heroic poetry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
in our religion, as that of the ancients has been to
raise theirs by all the fables of their gods, which
were only received for truths by the most ignorant
and weakest of the people.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<p>It is a doctrine almost universally received by
Christians, as well Protestants as Catholics, that
there are guardian angels, appointed by God Almighty,
as his vicegerents, for the protection and
government of cities, provinces, kingdoms, and monarchies;
and those as well of heathens, as of true
believers. All this is so plainly proved from those
texts of Daniel, that it admits of no farther controversy.
The prince of the Persians, and that other
of the Grecians, are granted to be the guardians
and protecting ministers of those empires. It cannot
be denied, that they were opposite, and resisted
one another. St Michael is mentioned by his name
as the patron of the Jews,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and is now taken by the
Christians, as the protector-general of our religion.
These tutelar genii, who presided over the several
people and regions committed to their charge, were
watchful over them for good, as far as their commissions
could possibly extend. The general purpose,
and design of all, was certainly the service of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
their Great Creator. But it is an undoubted truth,
that, for ends best known to the Almighty Majesty
of heaven, his providential designs for the benefit
of his creatures, for the debasing and punishing of
some nations, and the exaltation and temporal reward
of others, were not wholly known to these his
ministers; else why those factious quarrels, controversies,
and battles amongst themselves, when they
were all united in the same design, the service and
honour of their common master? But being instructed
only in the general, and zealous of the
main design; and, as finite beings, not admitted into
the secrets of government, the last resorts of providence,
or capable of discovering the final purposes
of God, who can work good out of evil as he
pleases, and irresistibly sways all manner of events
on earth, directing them finally for the best, to his
creation in general, and to the ultimate end of his
own glory in particular; they must, of necessity, be
sometimes ignorant of the means conducing to those
ends, in which alone they can jar and oppose each
other. One angel, as we may suppose&mdash;the Prince
of Persia, as he is called, judging, that it would be
more for God's honour, and the benefit of his people,
that the Median and Persian monarchy, which delivered
them from the Babylonish captivity, should
still be uppermost; and the patron of the Grecians,
to whom the will of God might be more particularly
revealed, contending, on the other side, for the
rise of Alexander and his successors, who were appointed
to punish the backsliding Jews, and thereby
to put them in mind of their offences, that they
might repent, and become more virtuous, and more
observant of the law revealed. But how far these
controversies, and appearing enmities, of those glorious
creatures may be carried; how these oppositions
may be best managed, and by what means con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>ducted,
is not my business to show or determine;
these things must be left to the invention and judgement
of the poet: if any of so happy a genius be
now living, or any future age can produce a man,
who, being conversant in the philosophy of Plato,
as it is now accommodated to Christian use, (for,
as Virgil gives us to understand by his example,
that is the only proper, of all others, for an epic
poem,) who, to his natural endowments, of a large
invention, a ripe judgment, and a strong memory,
has joined the knowledge of the liberal arts and
sciences, and particularly moral philosophy, the mathematics,
geography, and history, and with all
these qualifications is born a poet; knows, and can
practise the variety of numbers, and is master of the
language in which he writes;&mdash;if such a man, I say,
be now arisen, or shall arise, I am vain enough to
think, that I have proposed a model to him, by
which he may build a nobler, a more beautiful, and
more perfect poem, than any yet extant since the
ancients.</p>

<p>There is another part of these machines yet wanting;
but, by what I have said, it would have been
easily supplied by a judicious writer. He could not
have failed to add the opposition of ill spirits to the
good; they have also their design, ever opposite to
that of heaven; and this alone has hitherto been
the practice of the moderns: but this imperfect
system, if I may call it such, which I have given,
will infinitely advance and carry farther that hypothesis
of the evil spirits contending with the good.
For, being so much weaker, since their fall, than
those blessed beings, they are yet supposed to have
a permitted power from God of acting ill, as, from
their own depraved nature, they have always the
will of designing it. A great testimony of which
we find in holy writ, when God Almighty suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Satan to appear in the holy synod of the angels, (a
thing not hitherto drawn into example by any of
the poets,) and also gave him power over all things
belonging to his servant Job, excepting only life.</p>

<p>Now, what these wicked spirits cannot compass,
by the vast disproportion of their forces to those of
the superior beings, they may, by their fraud and
cunning, carry farther, in a seeming league, confederacy,
or subserviency to the designs of some good
angel, as far as consists with his purity to suffer
such an aid, the end of which may possibly be disguised,
and concealed from his finite knowledge.
This is, indeed, to suppose a great error in such a
being: yet since a devil can appear like an angel of
light; since craft and malice may sometimes blind,
for a while, a more perfect understanding; and,
lastly, since Milton has given us an example of the
like nature, when Satan, appearing like a cherub to
Uriel, the intelligence of the sun, circumvented him
even in his own province, and passed only for a curious
traveller through those new-created regions,
that he might observe therein the workmanship of
God, and praise him in his works,&mdash;I know not
why, upon the same supposition, or some other, a
fiend may not deceive a creature of more excellency
than himself, but yet a creature; at least, by the
connivance, or tacit permission, of the Omniscient
Being.</p>

<p>Thus, my lord, I have, as briefly as I could, given
your lordship, and by you the world, a rude draught
of what I have been long labouring in my imagination,
and what I had intended to have put in practice,
(though far unable for the attempt of such a
poem,) and to have left the stage, (to which my genius
never much inclined me,) for a work which
would have taken up my life in the performance of
it. This, too, I had intended chiefly for the honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of my native country, to which a poet is particularly
obliged. Of two subjects, both relating to it, I
was doubtful whether I should choose that of King
Arthur conquering the Saxons, which, being farther
distant in time, gives the greater scope to my
invention; or that of Edward, the Black Prince,
in subduing Spain, and restoring it to the lawful
prince, though a great tyrant, Don Pedro the Cruel:
which, for the compass of time, including only the
expedition of one year; for the greatness of the action,
and its answerable event; for the magnanimity
of the English hero, opposed to the ingratitude of
the person whom he restored; and for the many
beautiful episodes, which I had interwoven with
the principal design, together with the characters
of the chiefest English persons; (wherein, after Virgil
and Spenser, I would have taken occasion to represent
my living friends and patrons of the noblest
families, and also shadowed the events of future
ages, in the succession of our imperial line,)&mdash;with
these helps, and those of the machines, which I
have mentioned, I might perhaps have done as well
as some of my predecessors, or at least chalked
out a way for others to amend my errors in a like
design; but being encouraged only with fair words
by King Charles II., my little salary ill paid, and
no prospect of a future subsistence, I was then discouraged
in the beginning of my attempt; and now
age has overtaken me, and want, a more insufferable
evil, through the change of the times, has wholly
disenabled me. Though I must ever acknowledge,
to the honour of your lordship, and the eternal memory
of your charity, that, since this revolution,
wherein I have patiently suffered the ruin of my
small fortune, and the loss of that poor subsistence
which I had from two kings, whom I had served
more faithfully than profitably to myself,&mdash;then your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
lordship was pleased, out of no other motive but
your own nobleness, without any desert of mine, or
the least solicitation from me, to make me a most
bountiful present, which, at that time, when I was
most in want of it, came most seasonably and unexpectedly
to my relief. That favour, my lord, is
of itself sufficient to bind any grateful man to a
perpetual acknowledgment, and to all the future
service, which one of my mean condition can ever
be able to perform. May the Almighty God return
it for me, both in blessing you here, and rewarding
you hereafter! I must not presume to defend the
cause for which I now suffer, because your lordship
is engaged against it; but the more you are so, the
greater is my obligation to you, for your laying
aside all the considerations of factions and parties,
to do an action of pure disinterested charity. This
is one amongst many of your shining qualities,
which distinguish you from others of your rank.
But let me add a farther truth, that, without these
ties of gratitude, and abstracting from them all, I
have a most particular inclination to honour you;
and, if it were not too bold an expression, to say, I
love you. It is no shame to be a poet, though it is
to be a bad one. Augustus C&aelig;sar of old, and Cardinal
Richlieu of late, would willingly have been
such; and David and Solomon were such. You
who, without flattery, are the best of the present
age in England, and would have been so, had you
been born in any other country, will receive more
honour in future ages, by that one excellency, than
by all those honours to which your birth has entitled
you, or your merits have acquired you.</p>

</div></div>

<p>I have formerly said in this epistle, that I could dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>tinguish
your writings from those of any others; it
is now time to clear myself from any imputation of
self-conceit on that subject. I assume not to myself
any particular lights in this discovery; they are
such only as are obvious to every man of sense and
judgment, who loves poetry, and understands it.
Your thoughts are always so remote from the common
way of thinking, that they are, as I may say,
of another species, than the conceptions of other
poets; yet you go not out of nature for any of
them. Gold is never bred upon the surface of the
ground, but lies so hidden, and so deep, that the
mines of it are seldom found; but the force of waters
casts it out from the bowels of mountains, and
exposes it amongst the sands of rivers; giving us
of her bounty, what we could not hope for by our
search. This success attends your lordship's thoughts,
which would look like chance, if it were not perpetual,
and always of the same tenor. If I grant that
there is care in it, it is such a care as would be
ineffectual and fruitless in other men. It is the
<i>curiosa felicitas</i> which Petronius ascribes to Horace
in his Odes. We have not wherewithal to imagine
so strongly, so justly, and so pleasantly; in short,
if we have the same knowledge, we cannot draw
out of it the same quintessence; we cannot give it
such a turn, such a propriety, and such a beauty;
something is deficient in the manner, or the words,
but more in the nobleness of our conception. Yet
when you have finished all, and it appears in its full
lustre, when the diamond is not only found, but the
roughness smoothed, when it is cut into a form,
and set in gold, then we cannot but acknowledge,
that it is the perfect work of art and nature; and
every one will be so vain, to think he himself could
have performed the like, until he attempts it. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
just the description that Horace makes of such a finished
piece: it appears so easy,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>Speret idem, sudet multum, frustraque laboret,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ausus idem.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And, besides all this, it is your lordship's particular
talent to lay your thoughts so close together, that,
were they closer, they would be crowded, and even
a due connection would be wanting. We are not
kept in expectation of two good lines, which are to
come after a long parenthesis of twenty bad; which
is the April poetry of other writers, a mixture of
rain and sunshine by fits: you are always bright,
even almost to a fault, by reason of the excess.
There is continual abundance, a magazine of thought,
and yet a perpetual variety of entertainment; which
creates such an appetite in your reader, that he is not
cloyed with any thing, but satisfied with all. It is
that which the Romans call, <i>c&aelig;na dubia</i>; where
there is such plenty, yet withal so much diversity,
and so good order, that the choice is difficult betwixt
one excellency and another; and yet the conclusion,
by a due climax, is evermore the best; that
is, as a conclusion ought to be, ever the most proper
for its place. See, my lord, whether I have not
studied your lordship with some application; and,
since you are so modest that you will not be judge
and party, I appeal to the whole world, if I have
not drawn your picture to a great degree of likeness,
though it is but in miniature, and that some of the
best features are yet wanting. Yet what I have
done is enough to distinguish you from any other,
which is the proposition that I took upon me to demonstrate.</p>

<p>And now, my lord, to apply what I have said to
my present business. The Satires of Juvenal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Persius appearing in this new English dress, cannot
so properly be inscribed to any man as to your lordship,
who are the first of the age in that way of
writing. Your lordship, amongst many other favours,
has given me your permission for this address; and
you have particularly encouraged me by your perusal
and approbation of the Sixth and Tenth Satires
of Juvenal, as I have translated them. My fellow-labourers
have likewise commissioned me, to perform,
in their behalf, this office of a dedication to you;
and will acknowledge, with all possible respect and
gratitude, your acceptance of their work. Some of
them have the honour to be known to your lordship
already; and they who have not yet that happiness,
desire it now. Be pleased to receive our common
endeavours with your wonted candour, without entitling
you to the protection of our common failings
in so difficult an undertaking. And allow me your
patience, if it be not already tired with this long
epistle, to give you, from the best authors, the origin,
the antiquity, the growth, the change, and the
completement of satire among the Romans; to describe,
if not define, the nature of that poem, with
its several qualifications and virtues, together with
the several sorts of it; to compare the excellencies
of Horace, Persius, and Juvenal, and show the particular
manners of their satires; and, lastly, to give
an account of this new way of version, which is attempted
in our performance: all which, according
to the weakness of my ability, and the best lights
which I can get from others, shall be the subject of
my following discourse.</p>

<p>The most perfect work of poetry, says our master
Aristotle, is tragedy. His reason is, because it is the
most united; being more severely confined within
the rules of action, time, and place. The action is entire,
of a piece, and one, without episodes; the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
limited to a natural day; and the place circumscribed
at least within the compass of one town, or city.
Being exactly proportioned thus, and uniform in all
its parts, the mind is more capable of comprehending
the whole beauty of it without distraction.</p>

<p>But, after all these advantages, an heroic poem is
certainly the greatest work of human nature. The
beauties and perfections of the other are but mechanical;
those of the epic are more noble: though
Homer has limited his place to Troy, and the fields
about it; his actions to forty-eight natural days,
whereof twelve are holidays, or cessation from business,
during the funeral of Patroclus.&mdash;To proceed;
the action of the epic is greater; the extention
of time enlarges the pleasure of the reader, and
the episodes give it more ornament, and more
variety. The instruction is equal; but the first is
only instructive, the latter forms a hero, and a
prince.</p>

<p>If it signifies any thing which of them is of the
more ancient family, the best and most absolute heroic
poem was written by Homer long before tragedy
was invented. But if we consider the natural
endowments, and acquired parts, which are necessary
to make an accomplished writer in either kind,
tragedy requires a less and more confined knowledge;
moderate learning, and observation of the
rules, is sufficient, if a genius be not wanting. But
in an epic poet, one who is worthy of that name,
besides an universal genius, is required universal
learning, together with all those qualities and acquisitions
which I have named above, and as many
more as I have, through haste or negligence, omitted.
And, after all, he must have exactly studied
Homer and Virgil, as his patterns; Aristotle and Horace,
as his guides; and Vida and Bossu, as their
commentators; with many others, both Italian and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
French critics, which I want leisure here to recommend.</p>

<p>In a word, what I have to say in relation to this
subject, which does not particularly concern satire,
is, that the greatness of an heroic poem, beyond
that of a tragedy, may easily be discovered, by observing
how few have attempted that work in comparison
to those who have written dramas; and, of
those few, how small a number have succeeded.
But leaving the critics, on either side, to contend
about the preference due to this or that sort of poetry,
I will hasten to my present business, which is
the antiquity and origin of satire, according to those
informations which I have received from the learned
Casaubon, Heinsius, Rigaltius, Dacier, and the
Dauphin's Juvenal; to which I shall add some observations
of my own.</p>

<p>There has been a long dispute among the modern
critics, whether the Romans derived their satire
from the Grecians, or first invented it themselves.
Julius Scaliger, and Heinsius, are of the first opinion;
Casaubon, Rigaltius, Dacier, and the publisher
of the Dauphin's Juvenal, maintain the latter.
If we take satire in the general signification of the
word, as it is used in all modern languages, for an
invective, it is certain that it is almost as old as
verse; and though hymns, which are praises of God,
may be allowed to have been before it, yet the defamation
of others was not long after it. After God
had cursed Adam and Eve in Paradise, the husband
and wife excused themselves, by laying the blame
on one another; and gave a beginning to those
conjugal dialogues in prose, which the poets have
perfected in verse. The third chapter of Job is one
of the first instances of this poem in holy scripture;
unless we will take it higher, from the latter end of
the second, where his wife advises him to curse his
Maker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>This original, I confess, is not much to the honour
of satire; but here it was nature, and that depraved:
when it became an art, it bore better fruit.
Only we have learnt thus much already, that scoffs
and revilings are of the growth of all nations: and,
consequently, that neither the Greek poets borrowed
from other people their art of railing, neither
needed the Romans to take it from them. But, considering
satire as a species of poetry, here the war
begins amongst the critics. Scaliger, the father,
will have it descend from Greece to Rome; and derives
the word satire from <i>Satyrus</i>, that mixed kind of
animal, or, as the ancients thought him, rural god,
made up betwixt a man and a goat; with a human
head, hooked nose, pouting lips, a bunch, or struma,
under the chin, pricked ears, and upright horns;
the body shagged with hair, especially from the
waist, and ending in a goat, with the legs and feet
of that creature. But Casaubon, and his followers,
with reason, condemn this derivation; and prove,
that from <i>Satyrus</i>, the word <i>satira</i>, as it signifies a
poem, cannot possibly descend. For <i>satira</i> is not
properly a substantive, but an adjective; to which
the word <i>lanx</i> (in English, a charger, or large platter)
is understood; so that the Greek poem, made
according to the manners of a Satyr, and expressing
his qualities, must properly be called satyrical, and
not satire. And thus far it is allowed that the Grecians
had such poems; but that they were wholly
different in species from that to which the Romans
gave the name of satire.</p>

<p>Aristotle divides all poetry, in relation to the progress
of it, into nature without art, art begun, and
art completed. Mankind, even the most barbarous,
have the seeds of poetry implanted in them. The
first specimen of it was certainly shown in the
praises of the Deity, and prayers to him; and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
they are of natural obligation, so they are likewise
of divine institution: which Milton observing, introduces
Adam and Eve every morning adoring God
in hymns and prayers. The first poetry was thus
begun, in the wild notes of natural poetry, before
the invention of feet, and measures. The Grecians
and Romans had no other original of their poetry.
Festivals and holidays soon succeeded to private
worship, and we need not doubt but they were enjoined
by the true God to his own people, as they
were afterwards imitated by the heathens; who, by
the light of reason, knew they were to invoke some
superior Being in their necessities, and to thank him
for his benefits. Thus, the Grecian holidays were
celebrated with offerings to Bacchus, and Ceres, and
other deities, to whose bounty they supposed they
were owing for their corn and wine, and other helps
of life; and the ancient Romans, as Horace tells us,
paid their thanks to mother Earth, or Vesta, to Silvanus,
and their Genius, in the same manner. But
as all festivals have a double reason of their institution,
the first of religion, the other of recreation, for
the unbending of our minds, so both the Grecians
and Romans agreed, after their sacrifices were performed,
to spend the remainder of the day in sports
and merriments; amongst which, songs and dances,
and that which they called wit, (for want of knowing
better,) were the chiefest entertainments. The
Grecians had a notion of Satyrs, whom I have already
described; and taking them, and the Sileni,
that is, the young Satyrs and the old, for the tutors,
attendants, and humble companions of their Bacchus,
habited themselves like those rural deities, and
imitated them in their rustic dances, to which they
joined songs, with some sort of rude harmony, but
without certain numbers; and to these they added
a kind of chorus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>The Romans, also, (as nature is the same in all
places,) though they knew nothing of those Grecian
demi-gods, nor had any communication with Greece,
yet had certain young men, who, at their festivals,
danced and sung, after their uncouth manner, to a
certain kind of verse, which they called Saturnian.
What it was, we have no certain light from antiquity
to discover; but we may conclude, that, like
the Grecian, it was void of art, or, at least, with
very feeble beginnings of it. Those ancient Romans,
at these holidays, which were a mixture of
devotion and debauchery, had a custom of reproaching
each other with their faults, in a sort of extempore
poetry, or rather of tunable hobbling verse; and
they answered in the same kind of gross raillery;
their wit and their music being of a piece. The
Grecians, says Casaubon, had formerly done the
same, in the persons of their petulant Satyrs. But I
am afraid he mistakes the matter, and confounds
the singing and dancing of the Satyrs, with the rustical
entertainments of the first Romans. The reason
of my opinion is this; that Casaubon, finding
little light from antiquity of these beginnings of
poetry amongst the Grecians, but only these representations
of Satyrs, who carried canisters and cornucopias
full of several fruits in their hands, and
danced with them at their public feasts; and afterwards
reading Horace, who makes mention of his
homely Romans jesting at one another in the same
kind of solemnities, might suppose those wanton
Satyrs did the same; and especially because Horace
possibly might seem to him, to have shown the original
of all poetry in general, including the Grecians
as well as Romans; though it is plainly otherwise,
that he only described the beginning, and
first rudiments, of poetry in his own country. The
verses are these, which he cites from the First Epis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>tle
of the Second Book, which was written to Augustus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Agricol&aelig; prisci, fortes, parvoque beati,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Condita post frumenta, levantes tempore festo</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Cum sociis operum, et pueris, et conjuge fid&acirc;,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tellurem porco, Silvanum lacte piabant;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Floribus et vino Genium memorem brevis &aelig;vi.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Fescennina per hunc inventa licentia morem</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Versibus alternis opprobria rustica fudit.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our brawny clowns, of old, who turned the soil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Content with little, and inured to toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At harvest-home, with mirth and country cheer,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From flowing cups, defaming rhymes ensue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at each other homely taunts they threw.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yet since it is a hard conjecture, that so great a
man as Casaubon should misapply what Horace
writ concerning ancient Rome, to the ceremonies
and manners of ancient Greece, I will not insist on
this opinion; but rather judge in general, that since
all poetry had its original from religion, that of
the Grecians and Rome had the same beginning.
Both were invented at festivals of thanksgiving,
and both were prosecuted with mirth and raillery,
and rudiments of verses: amongst the Greeks, by
those who represented Satyrs; and amongst the Romans,
by real clowns.</p>

<p>For, indeed, when I am reading Casaubon on
these two subjects, methinks I hear the same story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
told twice over with very little alteration. Of which
Dacier taking notice, in his interpretation of the
Latin verses which I have translated, says plainly,
that the beginning of poetry was the same, with a
small variety, in both countries; and that the mother
of it, in all nations, was devotion. But, what
is yet more wonderful, that most learned critic takes
notice also, in his illustrations on the First Epistle of
the Second Book, that as the poetry of the Romans,
and that of the Grecians, had the same beginning,
(at feasts and thanksgiving, as it has been observed,)
and the old comedy of the Greeks, which was invective,
and the satire of the Romans, which was of
the same nature, were begun on the very same occasion,
so the fortune of both, in process of time,
was just the same; the old comedy of the Grecians
was forbidden, for its too much licence in exposing
of particular persons; and the rude satire of the
Romans was also punished by a law of the Decemviri,
as Horace tells us, in these words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Libertasque recurrentes accepta per annos</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Lusit amabiliter; donec jam s&aelig;vus apertam</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In rabiem verti c&oelig;pit jocus, et per honestas</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ire domos impune minax: doluere cruento</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dente lacessiti; fuit intactis quoque cura</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Conditione super communi: quinetiam lex,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>P&oelig;naque lata, malo qu&aelig; nollet carmine quenquam</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Describi: vertere modum, formidine fustis</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ad benedicendum delectandumque redacti.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The law of the Decemviri was this: <i>Siquis occentassit</i>
<i>malum carmen, sive condidisit, quod infamiam faxit,</i>
<i>flagitiumve alteri, capital esto</i>.&mdash;A strange likeness,
and barely possible; but the critics being all of the
same opinion, it becomes me to be silent, and to
submit to better judgments than my own.</p>

<p>But, to return to the Grecians, from whose satiric
dramas the elder Scaliger and Heinsius will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the Roman satire to proceed, I am to take a view
of them first, and see if there be any such descent
from them as those authors have pretended.</p>

<p>Thespis, or whoever he were that invented tragedy,
(for authors differ,) mingled with them a chorus
and dances of Satyrs, which had before been
used in the celebration of their festivals; and there
they were ever afterwards retained. The character
of them was also kept, which was mirth and wantonness;
and this was given, I suppose, to the folly
of the common audience, who soon grow weary
of good sense, and, as we daily see in our own age
and country, are apt to forsake poetry, and still
ready to return to buffoonery and farce. From
hence it came, that, in the Olympic games, where
the poets contended for four prizes, the satiric tragedy
was the last of them; for, in the rest, the Satyrs
were excluded from the chorus. Among the
plays of Euripides which are yet remaining, there
is one of these <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Satyrics</span></em>, which is called "The Cyclops;"
in which we may see the nature of those
poems, and from thence conclude, what likeness
they have to the Roman <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Satire</span></em>.</p>

<p>The story of this Cyclops, whose name was Polyphemus,
so famous in the Grecian fables, was,
that Ulysses, who, with his company, was driven on
the coast of Sicily, where those Cyclops inhabited,
coming to ask relief from Silenus, and the Satyrs,
who were herdsmen to that one-eyed giant, was
kindly received by them, and entertained; till, being
perceived by Polyphemus, they were made prisoners
against the rites of hospitality, (for which
Ulysses eloquently pleaded,) were afterwards put
down into the den, and some of them devoured; after
which Ulysses, having made him drunk, when
he was asleep, thrust a great firebrand into his eye,
and so, revenging his dead followers, escaped with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the remaining party of the living; and Silenus and
the Satyrs were freed from their servitude under
Polyphemus, and remitted to their first liberty of
attending and accompanying their patron, Bacchus.</p>

<p>This was the subject of the tragedy; which, being
one of those that end with a happy event, is
therefore, by Aristotle, judged below the other sort,
whose success is unfortunate. Notwithstanding
which, the Satyrs, who were part of the <i>dramatis</i>
<i>person&aelig;</i>, as well as the whole chorus, were properly
introduced into the nature of the poem, which is
mixed of farce and tragedy. The adventure of
Ulysses was to entertain the judging part of the audience;
and the uncouth persons of Silenus, and the
Satyrs, to divert the common people with their gross
railleries.</p>

<p>Your lordship has perceived by this time, that
this <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">SATIRIC</span></em> tragedy, and the Roman <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">SATIRE</span></em>, have
little resemblance in any of their features. The very
kinds are different; for what has a pastoral tragedy
to do with a paper of verses satirically written?
The character and raillery of the Satyrs is the only
thing that could pretend to a likeness, were Scaliger
and Heinsius alive to maintain their opinion.
And the first farces of the Romans, which were the
rudiments of their poetry, were written before they
had any communication with the Greeks, or indeed
any knowledge of that people.</p>

<p>And here it will be proper to give the definition
of the Greek satyric poem from Casaubon, before I
leave this subject. "The <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">SATIRIC</span></em>," says he, "is
a dramatic poem, annexed to a tragedy, having a
chorus, which consists of Satyrs. The persons represented
in it are illustrious men; the action of it
is great; the style is partly serious, and partly jo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>cular;
and the event of the action most commonly
is happy."</p>

<p>The Grecians, besides these <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">SATIRIC</span></em> tragedies, had
another kind of poem, which they called Silli, which
were more of kin to the Roman satire. Those Silli
were indeed invective poems, but of a different species
from the Roman poems of Ennius, Pacuvius, Lucilius,
Horace, and the rest of their successors. They
were so called, says Casaubon in one place, from
Silenus, the foster-father of Bacchus; but, in another
place, bethinking himself better, he derives their
name, &alpha;&pi;&#x1F78; &tau;&omicron;&#x1FE6; &sigma;&iota;&lambda;&lambda;&alpha;&iota;&nu;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;, from their scoffing and petulancy.
From some fragments of the Silli, written
by Timon, we may find, that they were satiric
poems, full of parodies; that is, of verses patched
up from great poets, and turned into another sense
than their author intended them. Such, amongst
the Romans, is the famous Cento of Ausonius;
where the words are Virgil's, but, by applying them
to another sense, they are made a relation of a
wedding-night; and the act of consummation fulsomely
described in the very words of the most modest
amongst all poets. Of the same manner are
our songs, which are turned into burlesque, and the
serious words of the author perverted into a ridiculous
meaning. Thus in Timon's Silli the words
are generally those of Homer, and the tragic poets;
but he applies them, satirically, to some customs and
kinds of philosophy, which he arraigns. But the
Romans, not using any of these parodies in their
satires,&mdash;sometimes, indeed, repeating verses of
other men, as Persius cites some of Nero's, but not
turning them into another meaning,&mdash;the Silli cannot
be supposed to be the original of Roman satire.
To these Silli, consisting of parodies, we may
properly add the satires which were written against
particular persons; such as were the Iambics of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Archilochus against Lycambes, which Horace undoubtedly
imitated in some of his Odes and Epodes,
whose titles bear sufficient witness of it. I might
also name the invective of Ovid against Ibis, and
many others; but these are the under-wood of satire,
rather than the timber-trees: they are not of
general extension, as reaching only to some individual
person. And Horace seems to have purged
himself from those splenetic reflections in those
Odes and Epodes, before he undertook the noble
work of Satires, which were properly so called.</p>

<p>Thus, my lord, I have at length disengaged myself
from those antiquities of Greece; and have
proved, I hope, from the best critics, that the Roman
satire was not borrowed from thence, but of
their own manufacture. I am now almost gotten
into my depth; at least, by the help of Dacier, I
am swimming towards it. Not that I will promise
always to follow him, any more than he follows
Casaubon; but to keep him in my eye, as my best
and truest guide; and where I think he may possibly
mislead me, there to have recourse to my own
lights, as I expect that others should do by me.</p>

<p>Quintilian says, in plain words, <i>Satira quidem</i>
<i>tota nostra est</i>; and Horace had said the same thing
before him, speaking of his predecessor in that sort
of poetry,&mdash;<i>Et Gr&aelig;cis intacti carminis auctor</i>. Nothing
can be clearer than the opinion of the poet,
and the orator, both the best critics of the two best
ages of the Roman empire, that satire was wholly
of Latin growth, and not transplanted to Rome
from Athens.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Yet, as I have said, Scaliger,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>the father, according to his custom, that is, insolently
enough, contradicts them both; and gives
no better reason, than the derivation of <i>satyrus</i>
from &#963;&#945;&#952;&#965;, <i>salacitas</i>; and so, from the lechery of
those fauns, thinks he has sufficiently proved, that
satire is derived from them: as if wantonness and
lubricity were essential to that sort of poem, which
ought to be avoided in it. His other allegation,
which I have already mentioned, is as pitiful; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the Satyrs carried platters and canisters full of
fruit in their hands. If they had entered empty-handed,
had they been ever the less Satyrs? Or
were the fruits and flowers, which they offered,
any thing of kin to satire? Or any argument that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>this poem was originally Grecian? Casaubon judged
better, and his opinion is grounded on sure authority,
that satire was derived from <i>satura</i>, a Roman
word, which signifies&mdash;full and abundant, and full
also of variety, in which nothing is wanting to its
due perfection. It is thus, says Dacier, that we say&mdash;a
full colour, when the wool has taken the whole
tincture, and drunk in as much of the dye as it can
receive. According to this derivation, from <i>satur</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>comes <i>satura</i>, or <i>satyra</i>, according to the new spelling;
as <i>optumus</i> and <i>maxumus</i> are now spelled <i>optimus</i>
and <i>maximus</i>. <i>Satura</i>, as I have formerly noted,
is an adjective, and relates to the word <i>lanx</i>
which is understood; and this <i>lanx</i>, in English a
charger, or large platter, was yearly filled with all
sorts of fruits, which were offered to the gods at
their festivals, as the <i>premices</i>, or first gatherings.
These offerings of several sorts thus mingled, it is
true, were not unknown to the Grecians, who called
them &pi;&alpha;&gamma;&kappa;&alpha;&rho;&pi;&#x1F78;&nu; &theta;&upsilon;&sigma;&#x1F77;&alpha;&nu;, a sacrifice of all sorts of fruits;
and &pi;&alpha;&nu;&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&mu;&#x1F77;&alpha;&nu;, when they offered all kinds of grain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Virgil has mentioned these sacrifices in his "Georgics:"</p>

<p class="center"><i>Lancibus et pandis fumantia reddimus exta</i>:
</p>

<p>and in another place, <i>lancesque et liba feremus</i>: that is,
We offer the smoaking entrails in great platters,
and we will offer the chargers and the cakes.</p>

<p>The word <i>satura</i> has been afterwards applied to
many other sort of mixtures; as Festus calls it a
kind of <i>olla</i>, or hotchpotch, made of several sorts of
meats. Laws were also called <i>leges satur&aelig;</i>, when
they were of several heads and titles, like our tacked
bills of parliament: and <i>per saturam legem ferre</i>,
in the Roman senate, was to carry a law without
telling the senators, or counting voices, when
they were in haste. Sallust uses the word,&mdash;<i>per</i>
<i>saturam sententias exquirere</i>; when the majority was
visible on one side. From hence it may probably
be conjectured, that the Discourses, or Satires, of
Ennius, Lucilius, and Horace, as we now call them,
took their name; because they are full of various
matters, and are also written on various subjects,
as Porphyrius says. But Dacier affirms,
that it is not immediately from thence that these
satires are so called; for that name had been used
formerly for other things, which bore a nearer resemblance
to those discourses of Horace. In explaining
of which, continues Dacier, a method is to
be pursued, of which Casaubon himself has never
thought, and which will put all things into so clear
a light, that no farther room will be left for the
least dispute.</p>

<p>During the space of almost four hundred years,
since the building of their city, the Romans had
never known any entertainments of the stage.
Chance and jollity first found out those verses which
they called <i>Saturnian</i>, and <i>Fescennine</i>; or rather
human nature, which is inclined to poetry, first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
produced them, rude and barbarous, and unpolished,
as all other operations of the soul are in their beginnings,
before they are cultivated with art and
study. However, in occasions of merriment they
were first practised; and this rough-cast unhewn
poetry was instead of stage-plays, for the space of
an hundred and twenty years together. They
were made <i>extempore</i>, and were, as the French call
them, <i>imprompt&ugrave;s</i>; for which the Tarsians of old
were much renowned; and we see the daily examples
of them in the Italian farces of Harlequin
and Scaramucha. Such was the poetry of that
savage people, before it was turned into numbers,
and the harmony of verse. Little of the Saturnian
verses is now remaining; we only know from authors,
that they were nearer prose than poetry, without
feet, or measure. They were &#x1F73;&nu;&rho;&upsilon;&theta;&mu;&omicron;&iota;, but not &#x1F73;&mu;&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&rho;&omicron;&iota;.
Perhaps they might be used in the solemn part
of their ceremonies; and the Fescennine, which
were invented after them, in the afternoon's debauchery,
because they were scoffing and obscene.</p>

<p>The Fescennine and Saturnian were the same;
for as they were called Saturnian from their ancientness,
when Saturn reigned in Italy, they were also
called Fescennine, from Fescennia, a town in the
same country, where they were first practised. The
actors, with a gross and rustic kind of raillery, reproached
each other with their failings; and at the
same time were nothing sparing of it to their audience.
Somewhat of this custom was afterwards
retained in the Saturnalia, or feasts of Saturn, celebrated
in December; at least all kind of freedom
in speech was then allowed to slaves, even against
their masters; and we are not without some imitation
of it in our Christmas gambols. Soldiers also
used those Fescennine verses, after measure and
numbers had been added to them, at the triumph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
of their generals: of which we have an example, in
the triumph of Julius C&aelig;sar over Gaul, in these expressions:
<i>C&aelig;sar Gallias subegit, Nicomedes C&aelig;sarem.</i>
<i>Ecce C&aelig;sar nunc triumphat, qui subegit Gallias:</i>
<i>Nicomedes non triumphat, qui subegit C&aelig;sarem</i>. The vapours
of wine made those first satirical poets amongst
the Romans; which, says Dacier, we cannot better
represent, than by imagining a company of clowns
on a holiday, dancing lubberly, and upbraiding one
another, in <i>extempore</i> doggrel, with their defects and
vices, and the stories that were told of them in
bake houses and barbers' shops.</p>

<p>When they began to be somewhat better bred,
and were entering, as I may say, into the first rudiments
of civil conversation, they left these hedge-notes
for another sort of poem, somewhat polished,
which was also full of pleasant raillery, but without
any mixture of obscenity. This sort of poetry appeared
under the name of satire, because of its variety;
and this satire was adorned with compositions
of music, and with dances; but lascivious
postures were banished from it. In the Tuscan
language, says Livy, the word <i>hister</i> signifies a
player; and therefore those actors, which were first
brought from Etruria to Rome, on occasion of a
pestilence, when the Romans were admonished to
avert the anger of the Gods by plays, in the year
<i>ab urbe condita</i> <span class="smcap">CCCXC.</span>,&mdash;those actors, I say, were
therefore called <i>histriones</i>; and that name has since
remained, not only to actors Roman born, but to
all others of every nation. They played not the
former <i>extempore</i> stuff of Fescennine verses, or clownish
jests; but what they acted was a kind of civil,
cleanly farce, with music and dances, and motions
that were proper to the subject.</p>

<p>In this condition Livius Andronicus found the
stage, when he attempted first, instead of farces, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
supply it with a nobler entertainment of tragedies
and comedies. This man was a Grecian born, and
being made a slave by Livius Salinator, and brought
to Rome, had the education of his patron's children
committed to him; which trust he discharged so
much to the satisfaction of his master, that he gave
him his liberty.</p>

<p>Andronicus, thus become a freeman of Rome, added
to his own name that of Livius his master;
and, as I observed, was the first author of a regular
play in that commonwealth. Being already instructed,
in his native country, in the manners and
decencies of the Athenian theatre, and conversant
in the <i>Arch&aelig;a Com&oelig;dia</i>, or old comedy of Aristophanes,
and the rest of the Grecian poets, he took
from that model his own designing of plays for
the Roman stage; the first of which was represented
in the year <span class="smcap">CCCCCXIV.</span>, since the building of Rome,
as Tully, from the commentaries of Atticus, has assured
us: it was after the end of the first Punic
war, the year before Ennius was born. Dacier has
not carried the matter altogether thus far; he only
says, that one Livius Andronicus was the first
stage-poet at Rome. But I will adventure on this
hint, to advance another proposition, which I hope
the learned will approve. And though we have not
any thing of Andronicus remaining to justify my
conjecture, yet it is exceedingly probable, that, having
read the works of those Grecian wits, his
countrymen, he imitated not only the ground work,
but also the manner of their writing; and how
grave soever his tragedies might be, yet, in his comedies,
he expressed the way of Aristophanes, Eupolis,
and the rest, which was to call some persons
by their own names, and to expose their defects to
the laughter of the people: the examples of which
we have in the forementioned Aristophanes, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
turned the wise Socrates into ridicule, and is also
very free with the management of Cleon, Alcibiades,
and other ministers of the Athenian government.
Now, if this be granted, we may easily
suppose, that the first hint of satirical plays on
the Roman stage was given by the Greeks: not
from the Satirica, for that has been reasonably exploded
in the former part of this discourse: but
from their old comedy, which was imitated first by
Livius Andronicus. And then Quintilian and Horace
must be cautiously interpreted, where they affirm,
that satire is wholly Roman, and a sort of
verse, which was not touched on by the Grecians.
The reconcilement of my opinion to the standard
of their judgment is not, however, very difficult,
since they spoke of satire, not as in its first elements,
but as it was formed into a separate work;
begun by Ennius, pursued by Lucilius, and completed
afterwards by Horace. The proof depends
only on this <i>postulatum</i>,&mdash;that the comedies of
Andronicus, which were imitations of the Greek,
were also imitations of their railleries, and reflections
on particular persons. For, if this be granted
me, which is a most probable supposition, it is easy
to infer, that the first light which was given to the
Roman theatrical satire, was from the plays of Livius
Andronicus; which will be more manifestly
discovered, when I come to speak of Ennius. In
the meantime I will return to Dacier.</p>

<p>The people, says he, ran in crowds to these new
entertainments of Andronicus, as to pieces which
were more noble in their kind, and more perfect
than their former satires, which for some time they
neglected and abandoned. But not long after,
they took them up again, and then they joined
them to their comedies; playing them at the end
of every drama, as the French continue at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
day to act their farces, in the nature of a separate
entertainment from their tragedies. But more particularly
they were joined to the <i>Atellane</i> fables,
says Casaubon; which were plays invented by the
Osci. Those fables, says Valerius Maximus, out of
Livy, were tempered with the Italian severity, and
free from any note of infamy, or obsceneness; and,
as an old commentator of Juvenal affirms, the <i>Exodiarii</i>,
which were singers and dancers, entered to
entertain the people with light songs, and mimical
gestures, that they might not go away oppressed
with melancholy, from those serious pieces of the
theatre. So that the ancient satire of the Romans
was in <i>extempore</i> reproaches; the next was farce,
which was brought from Tuscany; to that succeeded
the plays of Andronicus, from the old comedy
of the Grecians; and out of all these sprung
two several branches of new Roman satire, like different
scions from the same root, which I shall
prove with as much brevity as the subject will allow.</p>

<p>A year after Andronicus had opened the Roman
stage with his new dramas, Ennius was born; who,
when he was grown to man's estate, having seriously
considered the genius of the people, and how
eagerly they followed the first satires, thought it
would be worth his pains to refine upon the project,
and to write Satires, not to be acted on the
theatre, but read. He preserved the ground-work
of their pleasantry, their venom, and their raillery
on particular persons, and general vices; and by
this means, avoiding the danger of any ill success
in a public representation, he hoped to be as well
received in the cabinet, as Andronicus had been upon
the stage. The event was answerable to his expectation.
He made discourses in several sorts of
verse, varied often in the same paper; retaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
still in the title their original name of Satire. Both
in relation to the subjects, and the variety of matters
contained in them, the Satires of Horace are
entirely like them; only Ennius, as I said, confines
not himself to one sort of verse, as Horace does;
but, taking example from the Greeks, and even
from Homer himself in his <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Margites</span></em>, which is a
kind of Satire, as Scaliger observes, gives himself
the licence, when one sort of numbers comes not
easily, to run into another, as his fancy dictates.
For he makes no difficulty to mingle hexameter
with iambick trimeters, or with trochaick tetrameters;
as appears by those fragments which are
yet remaining of him. Horace has thought him
worthy to be copied; inserting many things of his
into his own Satires, as Virgil has done into his
&AElig;neids.</p>

<p>Here we have Dacier making out that Ennius was
the first satirist in that way of writing, which was
of his invention; that is, satire abstracted from the
stage, and new modelled into papers of verses on several
subjects. But he will have Ennius take the
ground-work of satire from the first farces of the Romans,
rather than from the formed plays of Livius
Andronicus, which were copied from the Grecian comedies.
It may possibly be so; but Dacier knows
no more of it than I do. And it seems to me the
more probable opinion, that he rather imitated the
fine railleries of the Greeks, which he saw in the
pieces of Andronicus, than the coarseness of his old
countrymen, in their clownish extemporary way of
jeering.</p>

<p>But besides this, it is universally granted, that
Ennius, though an Italian, was excellently learned
in the Greek language. His verses were stuffed
with fragments of it, even to a fault; and he himself
believed, according to the Pythagorean opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
that the soul of Homer was transfused into him;
which Persius observes, in his Sixth Satire:&mdash;<i>Postquam</i>
<i>destertuit esse M&aelig;onides</i>. But this being only
the private opinion of so inconsiderable a man as I
am, I leave it to the farther disquisition of the critics,
if they think it worth their notice. Most evident
it is, that whether he imitated the Roman
farce, or the Greek comedies, he is to be acknowledged
for the first author of Roman satire, as it is
properly so called, and distinguished from any sort
of stage-play.</p>

<p>Of Pacuvius, who succeeded him, there is little
to be said, because there is so little remaining of
him; only that he is taken to be the nephew of
Ennius, his sister's son; that in probability he was
instructed by his uncle, in his way of satire, which
we are told he has copied: but what advances he
made we know not.</p>

<p>Lucilius came into the world, when Pacuvius
flourished most. He also made satires after the manner
of Ennius, but he gave them a more graceful
turn, and endeavoured to imitate more closely the
<i>vetus com&oelig;dia</i> of the Greeks, of the which the old
original Roman satire had no idea, till the time of
Livius Andronicus. And though Horace seems to
have made Lucilius the first author of satire in verse
amongst the Romans, in these words,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----<i>Quid? cum est Lucilius ausus</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Primus in hunc, operis componere carmina morem</i>,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he is only thus to be understood; that Lucilius had
given a more graceful turn to the satire of Ennius
and Pacuvius, not that he invented a new satire of
his own: and Quintilian seems to explain this passage
of Horace in these words: <i>Satira quidem tota</i>
<i>nostra est; in qu&acirc; primus insignem laudem adeptus est</i>
<i>Lucilius</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, both Horace and Quintilian give a kind of
primacy of honour to Lucilius, amongst the Latin
satirists.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> For, as the Roman language grew more
refined, so much more capable it was of receiving
the Grecian beauties, in his time. Horace and
Quintilian could mean no more, than that Lucilius
writ better than Ennius and Pacuvius; and on the
same account we prefer Horace to Lucilius. Both
of them imitated the old Greek comedy; and so
did Ennius and Pacuvius before them. The polishing
of the Latin tongue, in the succession of times,
made the only difference; and Horace himself, in
two of his Satires, written purposely on this subject,
thinks the Romans of his age were too partial in
their commendations of Lucilius; who writ not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
only loosely, and muddily, with little art, and much
less care, but also in a time when the Latin tongue
was not yet sufficiently purged from the dregs of
barbarism; and many significant and sounding words,
which the Romans wanted, were not admitted even
in the times of Lucretius and Cicero, of which both
complain.</p>

<p>But to proceed:&mdash;Dacier justly taxes Casaubon,
saying, that the Satires of Lucilius were wholly different
in specie, from those of Ennius and Pacuvius.
Casaubon was led into that mistake by Diomedes
the grammarian, who in effect says this: "Satire
amongst the Romans, but not amongst the Greeks,
was a biting invective poem, made after the model of
the ancient comedy, for the reprehension of vices;
such as were the poems of Lucilius, of Horace, and
of Persius. But in former times, the name of Satire
was given to poems, which were composed of
several sorts of verses, such as were made by Ennius
and Pacuvius; more fully expressing the etymology
of the word satire, from <i>satura</i>, which we
have observed." Here it is manifest, that Diomedes
makes a specifical distinction betwixt the Satires
of Ennius, and those of Lucilius. But this,
as we say in English, is only a distinction without
a difference; for the reason of it is ridiculous,
and absolutely false. This was that which cozened
honest Casaubon, who, relying on Diomedes, had
not sufficiently examined the origin and nature of
those two satires; which were entirely the same,
both in the matter and the form: for all that Lucilius
performed beyond his predecessors, Ennius
and Pacuvius, was only the adding of more politeness,
and more salt, without any change in the substance
of the poem. And though Lucilius put not
together in the same satire several sorts of verses,
as Ennius did, yet he composed several satires, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
several sorts of verses, and mingled them with
Greek verses: one poem consisted only of hexameters,
and another was entirely of iambicks; a
third of trochaicks; as is visible by the fragments
yet remaining of his works. In short, if the Satires
of Lucilius are therefore said to be wholly different
from those of Ennius, because he added much more
of beauty and polishing to his own poems, than are
to be found in those before him, it will follow from
hence, that the Satires of Horace are wholly different
from those of Lucilius, because Horace has not
less surpassed Lucilius in the elegancy of his writing,
than Lucilius surpassed Ennius in the turn
and ornament of his. This passage of Diomedes
has also drawn Dousa, the son, into the same error
of Casaubon, which I say, not to expose the little
failings of those judicious men, but only to make it
appear, with how much diffidence and caution we
are to read their works, when they treat a subject
of so much obscurity, and so very ancient, as is this
of satire.</p>

<p>Having thus brought down the history of Satire
from its original to the times of Horace, and shown
the several changes of it, I should here discover
some of those graces which Horace added to it, but
that I think it will be more proper to defer that undertaking,
till I make the comparison betwixt him
and Juvenal. In the mean while, following the
order of time, it will be necessary to say somewhat
of another kind of satire, which also was descended
from the ancients; it is that which we call the Varronian
satire, (but which Varro himself calls the
Menippean,) because Varro, the most learned of the
Romans, was the first author of it, who imitated, in
his works, the manner of Menippus the Gadarenian,
who professed the philosophy of the Cynicks.</p>

<p>This sort of satire was not only composed of se<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>veral
sorts of verse, like those of Ennius, but was
also mixed with prose; and Greek was sprinkled
amongst the Latin. Quintilian, after he had spoken
of the satire of Lucilius, adds what follows; "There
is another and former kind of satire, composed by
Terentius Varro, the most learned of the Romans;
in which he was not satisfied alone with mingling
in it several sorts of verse." The only difficulty of
this passage is, that Quintilian tells us, that this
satire of Varro was of a former kind. For how can
we possibly imagine this to be, since Varro, who was
contemporary to Cicero, must consequently be after
Lucilius? But Quintilian meant not, that the satire
of Varro was in order of time before Lucilius;
he would only give us to understand, that the Varronian
satire, with mixture of several sorts of verses,
was more after the manner of Ennius and Pacuvius,
than that of Lucilius, who was more severe, and
more correct; and gave himself less liberty in the
mixture of his verses in the same poem.</p>

<p>We have nothing remaining of those Varronian
satires, excepting some inconsiderable fragments,
and those for the most part much corrupted. The
titles of many of them are indeed preserved, and
they are generally double; from whence, at least,
we may understand, how many various subjects
were treated by that author. Tully, in his "Academics,"
introduces Varro himself giving us some
light concerning the scope and design of those
works. Wherein, after he had shown his reasons
why he did not <i>ex professo</i> write of philosophy, he
adds what follows: "Notwithstanding," says he,
"that those pieces of mine, wherein I have imitated
Menippus, though I have not translated him,
are sprinkled with a kind of mirth and gaiety, yet
many things are there inserted, which are drawn
from the very entrails of philosophy, and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
things severely argued; which I have mingled with
pleasantries on purpose, that they may more easily
go down with the common sort of unlearned readers."
The rest of the sentence is so lame, that we
can only make thus much out of it,&mdash;that in the
composition of his satires, he so tempered philology
with philosophy, that his work was a mixture of
them both.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> And Tully himself confirms us in this
opinion, when a little after he addresses himself to
Varro in these words:&mdash;"And you yourself have
composed a most elegant and complete poem; you
have begun philosophy in many places; sufficient
to incite us, though too little to instruct us." Thus
it appears, that Varro was one of those writers whom
they called &sigma;&pi;&omicron;&upsilon;&delta;&omicron;&gamma;&epsilon;&lambda;&omicron;&#x1FD6;&omicron;&iota;, studious of laughter; and
that, as learned as he was, his business was more to
divert his reader, than to teach him. And he entitled
his own satires&mdash;Menippean; not that Menippus
had written any satires, (for his were either dialogues
or epistles,) but that Varro imitated his style,
his manner, his facetiousness. All that we know
farther of Menippus and his writings, which are
wholly lost, is, that by some he is esteemed, as,
amongst the rest, by Varro; by others he is noted
of cynical impudence, and obscenity: that he was
much given to those parodies, which I have already
mentioned; that is, he often quoted the verses of
Homer and the tragic poets, and turned their seri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>ous
meaning into something that was ridiculous;
whereas Varro's satires are by Tully called absolute,
and most elegant, and various poems. Lucian, who
was emulous of this Menippus, seems to have imitated
both his manners and his style in many of his
dialogues; where Menippus himself is often introduced
as a speaker in them, and as a perpetual buffoon;
particularly his character is expressed in the
beginning of that dialogue, which is called &Nu;&epsilon;&kappa;&upsilon;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&iota;&alpha;.
But Varro, in imitating him, avoids his impudence
and filthiness, and only expresses his witty
pleasantry.</p>

<p>This we may believe for certain,&mdash;that as his subjects
were various, so most of them were tales or
stories of his own invention. Which is also manifest
from antiquity, by those authors who are acknowledged
to have written Varronian satires, in
imitation of his; of whom the chief is Petronius
Arbiter, whose satire, they say, is now printed in
Holland, wholly recovered, and made complete:
when it is made public, it will easily be seen by any
one sentence, whether it be supposititious, or genuine.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
Many of Lucian's dialogues may also properly
be called Varronian satires, particularly his
True History; and consequently the "Golden Ass"
of Apuleius, which is taken from him. Of the same
stamp is the mock deification of Claudius, by Seneca:
and the Symposium or "C&aelig;sars" of Julian, the
Emperor. Amongst the moderns, we may reckon the
"Encomium Mori&aelig;" of Erasmus, Barclay's "Euphormio,"
and a volume of German authors, which my
ingenious friend, Mr Charles Killegrew, once lent
me.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> In the English, I remember none which
are mixed with prose, as Varro's were; but of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>same kind is "Mother Hubbard's Tale" in Spenser;
and (if it be not too vain to mention any thing of my
own,) the poems of "Absalom" and "Mac Flecnoe."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>This is what I have to say in general of satire:
only, as Dacier has observed before me, we may
take notice, that the word satire is of a more general
signification in Latin, than in French, or English.
For amongst the Romans it was not only
used for those discourses which decried vice, or exposed
folly, but for others also, where virtue was
recommended. But in our modern languages we
apply it only to invective poems, where the very
name of satire is formidable to those persons, who
would appear to the world what they are not in
themselves; for in English, to say satire, is to mean
reflection, as we use that word in the worst sense;
or as the French call it, more properly, <i>medisance</i>.
In the criticism of spelling, it ought to be with <i>i</i>,
and not with <i>y</i>, to distinguish its true derivation
from <i>satura</i>, not from <i>satyrus</i>. And if this be so,
then it is false spelled throughout this book; for
here it is written <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Satyr</span></em>: which having not considered
at the first, I thought it not worth correcting
afterwards. But the French are more nice, and
never spell it any other way than <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Satire</span></em>.</p>

<p>I am now arrived at the most difficult part of my
undertaking, which is, to compare Horace with
Juvenal and Persius. It is observed by Rigaltius,
in his preface before Juvenal, written to Thuanus,
that these three poets have all their particular partisans,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>and favourers. Every commentator, as he has
taken pains with any of them, thinks himself obliged
to prefer his author to the other two; to find
out their failings, and decry them, that he may
make room for his own darling.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Such is the partiality
of mankind, to set up that interest which
they have once espoused, though it be to the prejudice
of truth, morality, and common justice; and
especially in the productions of the brain. As authors
generally think themselves the best poets, because
they cannot go out of themselves to judge
sincerely of their betters; so it is with critics, who,
having first taken a liking to one of these poets,
proceed to comment on him, and to illustrate him;
after which, they fall in love with their own labours,
to that degree of blind fondness, that at
length they defend and exalt their author, not so
much for his sake as for their own. It is a folly of
the same nature, with that of the Romans themselves,
in the games of the Circus. The spectators
were divided in their factions, betwixt the Veneti
and the Prasini; some were for the charioteer in
blue, and some for him in green. The colours
themselves were but a fancy; but when once a man
had taken pains to set out those of his party, and
had been at the trouble of procuring voices for them,
the case was altered; he was concerned for his own
labour, and that so earnestly, that disputes and
quarrels, animosities, commotions, and bloodshed,
often happened; and in the declension of the Grecian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>empire, the very sovereigns themselves engaged
in it, even when the barbarians were at their
doors; and stickled for the preference of colours,
when the safety of their people was in question. I
am now myself on the brink of the same precipice;
I have spent some time on the translation of Juvenal
and Persius; and it behoves me to be wary,
lest, for that reason, I should be partial to them, or
take a prejudice against Horace. Yet, on the other
side, I would not be like some of our judges, who
would give the cause for a poor man, right or
wrong; for though that be an error on the better
hand, yet it is still a partiality: and a rich man, unheard,
cannot be concluded an oppressor. I remember
a saying of King Charles II. on Sir Matthew
Hale, (who was doubtless an uncorrupt and upright
man,) that his servants were sure to be cast on a trial,
which was heard before him; not that he thought
the judge was possibly to be bribed, but that his
integrity might be too scrupulous; and that the
causes of the crown were always suspicious, when
the privileges of subjects were concerned.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>It had been much fairer, if the modern critics, who
have embarked in the quarrels of their favourite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>authors, had rather given to each his proper due;
without taking from another's heap, to raise their
own. There is praise enough for each of them in
particular, without encroaching on his fellows, and
detracting from them, or enriching themselves with
the spoils of others. But to come to particulars.
Heinsius and Dacier are the most principal of those,
who raise Horace above Juvenal and Persius. Scaliger
the father, Rigaltius, and many others, debase
Horace, that they may set up Juvenal; and
Casaubon,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> who is almost single, throws dirt on
Juvenal and Horace, that he may exalt Persius,
whom he understood particularly well, and better
than any of his former commentators; even Stelluti,
who succeeded him. I will begin with him, who, in
my opinion, defends the weakest cause, which is that
of Persius; and labouring, as Tacitus professes of
his own writing, to divest myself of partiality, or
prejudice, consider Persius, not as a poet whom I
have wholly translated, and who has cost me more
labour and time than Juvenal, but according to
what I judge to be his own merit; which I think
not equal, in the main, to that of Juvenal or Horace,
and yet in some things to be preferred to both
of them.</p>

<p>First, then, for the verse; neither Casaubon himself,
nor any for him, can defend either his numbers,
or the purity of his Latin. Casaubon gives this
point for lost, and pretends not to justify either
the measures, or the words of Persius; he is evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>beneath Horace and Juvenal in both.</p>

<p>Then, as his verse is scabrous, and hobbling, and
his words not every where well chosen, the purity
of Latin being more corrupted than in the time of
Juvenal,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and consequently of Horace, who writ
when the language was in the height of its perfection,
so his diction is hard, his figures are generally
too bold and daring, and his tropes, particularly his
metaphors, insufferably strained.</p>

<p>In the third place, notwithstanding all the diligence
of Casaubon, Stelluti, and a Scotch gentleman,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
whom I have heard extremely commended
for his illustrations of him, yet he is still obscure:
whether he affected not to be understood, but with
difficulty; or whether the fear of his safety under
Nero compelled him to this darkness in some places;
or that it was occasioned by his close way of thinking,
and the brevity of his style, and crowding of
his figures; or lastly, whether, after so long a time,
many of his words have been corrupted, and many
customs, and stories relating to them, lost to us:
whether some of these reasons, or all, concurred to
render him so cloudy, we may be bold to affirm,
that the best of commentators can but guess at his
meaning, in many passages; and none can be certain
that he has divined rightly.</p>

<p>After all, he was a young man, like his friend
and contemporary Lucan; both of them men of extraordinary
parts, and great acquired knowledge,
considering their youth:<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> But neither of them had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>arrived to that maturity of judgment, which is necessary
to the accomplishing of a formed poet. And
this consideration, as, on the one hand, it lays some
imperfections to their charge, so, on the other side,
it is a candid excuse for those failings, which are
incident to youth and inexperience; and we have
more reason to wonder how they, who died before
the thirtieth year of their age, could write so well,
and think so strongly, than to accuse them of those
faults, from which human nature, and more especially
in youth, can never possibly be exempted.</p>

<p>To consider Persius yet more closely: he rather
insulted over vice and folly, than exposed them,
like Juvenal and Horace; and as chaste and modest
as he is esteemed, it cannot be denied, but that
in some places he is broad and fulsome, as the latter
verses of the fourth Satire, and of the sixth, sufficiently
witnessed. And it is to be believed that he
who commits the same crime often, and without
necessity, cannot but do it with some kind of pleasure.</p>

<p>To come to a conclusion: he is manifestly below
Horace, because he borrows most of his greatest
beauties from him; and Casaubon is so far from
denying this, that he has written a treatise purposely
concerning it; wherein he shews a multitude of
his translations from Horace, and his imitations of
him, for the credit of his author; which he calls
<i>Imitatio Horatiana</i>.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>To these defects, which I casually observed, while
I was translating this author, Scaliger has added
others; he calls him, in plain terms, a silly writer,
and a trifler, full of ostentation of his learning, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>after all, unworthy to come into competition with
Juvenal and Horace.</p>

<p>After such terrible accusations, it is time to hear
what his patron Casaubon can allege in his defence.
Instead of answering, he excuses for the
most part; and, when he cannot, accuses others of
the same crimes. He deals with Scaliger, as a
modest scholar with a master. He compliments
him with so much reverence, that one would swear
he feared him as much at least as he respected him.
Scaliger will not allow Persius to have any wit;
Casaubon interprets this in the mildest sense, and
confesses his author was not good at turning things
into a pleasant ridicule; or, in other words, that he
was not a laughable writer. That he was <i>ineptus</i>,
indeed, but that was <i>non aptissimus ad jocandum</i>;
but that he was ostentatious of his learning, that,
by Scaliger's good favour, he denies. Persius shewed
his learning, but was no boaster of it; he did
<i>ostendere</i>, but not <i>ostentare</i>; and so, he says, did
Scaliger:&mdash;where, methinks, Casaubon turns it handsomely
upon that supercilious critic, and silently
insinuates that he himself was sufficiently vain-glorious,
and a boaster of his own knowledge. All the
writings of this venerable censor, continues Casaubon,
which are &chi;&rho;&upsilon;&sigma;&omicron;&#x1FE6; &chi;&rho;&upsilon;&sigma;&#x1F79;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;, more golden than
gold itself, are every where smelling of that thyme,
which, like a bee, he has gathered from ancient
authors; but far be ostentation and vain-glory
from a gentleman so well born, and so nobly educated
as Scaliger. But, says Scaliger, he is so obscure,
that he has got himself the name of Scotinus,
a dark writer; now, says Casaubon, it is a wonder
to me that any thing could be obscure to the divine
wit of Scaliger, from which nothing could be hidden.
This is indeed a strong compliment, but no
defence; and Casaubon, who could not but be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
sensible of his author's blind side, thinks it time to
abandon a post that was untenable. He acknowledges
that Persius is obscure in some places; but
so is Plato, so is Thucydides; so are Pindar, Theocritus,
and Aristophanes, amongst the Greek poets;
and even Horace and Juvenal, he might have added,
amongst the Romans. The truth is, Persius
is not sometimes, but generally, obscure; and therefore
Casaubon, at last, is forced to excuse him, by
alledging that it was <i>se defendendo</i>, for fear of Nero;
and that he was commanded to write so cloudily by
Cornutus,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> in virtue of holy obedience to his master.
I cannot help my own opinion; I think Cornutus
needed not to have read many lectures to him on
that subject. Persius was an apt scholar; and when
he was bidden to be obscure in some places, where
his life and safety were in question, took the same
counsel for all his books; and never afterwards
wrote ten lines together clearly. Casaubon, being
upon this chapter, has not failed, we may be sure,
of making a compliment to his own dear comment.
If Persius, says he, be in himself obscure, yet my
interpretation has made him intelligible. There is
no question but he deserves that praise, which he
has given to himself; but the nature of the thing,
as Lucretius says, will not admit of a perfect explanation.
Besides many examples which I could
urge, the very last verse of his last satire, upon which
he particularly values himself in his preface, is not
yet sufficiently explicated. It is true, Holyday has
endeavoured to justify his construction; but Stelluti
is against it; and, for my part, I can have but
a very dark notion of it. As for the chastity of his
thoughts, Casaubon denies not but that one particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>passage, in the fourth satire, <i>At si unctus cesses</i>,
&amp;c. is not only the most obscure, but the most obscene
of all his works. I understood it; but for that
reason turned it over. In defence of his boisterous
metaphors, he quotes Longinus, who accounts them
as instruments of the sublime; fit to move and stir
up the affections, particularly in narration. To which
it may be replied, that where the trope is far fetched
and hard, it is fit for nothing but to puzzle the
understanding; and may be reckoned amongst
those things of Demosthenes which &AElig;schines called
&theta;&alpha;&#x1F7B;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;, not &#x1FE5;&eta;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;, that is, prodigies, not words.
It must be granted to Casaubon, that the knowledge
of many things is lost in our modern ages,
which were of familiar notice to the ancients; and
that satire is a poem of a difficult nature in itself,
and is not written to vulgar readers: and through
the relation which it has to comedy, the frequent
change of persons makes the sense perplexed, when
we can but divine who it is that speaks; whether
Persius himself, or his friend and monitor; or, in
some places, a third person. But Casaubon comes
back always to himself, and concludes, that if Persius
had not been obscure, there had been no need
of him for an interpreter. Yet when he had once
enjoined himself so hard a task, he then considered
the Greek proverb, that he must &chi;&epsilon;&lambda;&#x1F7D;&nu;&epsilon;&sigmaf; &phi;&alpha;&gamma;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&nu; &#x1F22; &mu;&#x1F74; &phi;&alpha;&gamma;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&nu;,
either eat the whole snail, or let it quite
alone; and so he went through with his laborious
task, as I have done with my difficult translation.</p>

<p>Thus far, my lord, you see it has gone very hard
with Persius: I think he cannot be allowed to
stand in competition either with Juvenal or Horace.
Yet for once I will venture to be so vain, as
to affirm, that none of his hard metaphors, or forced
expressions, are in my translation. But more of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>this
in its proper place, where I shall say somewhat in
particular, of our general performance, in making
these two authors English. In the mean time, I
think myself obliged to give Persius his undoubted
due, and to acquaint the world, with Casaubon, in
what he has equalled, and in what excelled, his two
competitors.</p>

<p>A man who is resolved to praise an author, with
any appearance of justice, must be sure to take him
on the strongest side, and where he is least liable
to exceptions. He is therefore obliged to chuse his
mediums accordingly. Casaubon, who saw that
Persius could not laugh with a becoming grace,
that he was not made for jesting, and that a merry
conceit was not his talent, turned his feather, like
an Indian, to another light, that he might give it
the better gloss. Moral doctrine, says he, and urbanity,
or well-mannered wit, are the two things
which constitute the Roman satire; but of the two,
that which is most essential to this poem, and is, as
it were, the very soul which animates it, is the
scourging of vice, and exhortation to virtue. Thus
wit, for a good reason, is already almost out of
doors; and allowed only for an instrument, a kind
of tool, or a weapon, as he calls it, of which the
satirist makes use in the compassing of his design.
The end and aim of our three rivals is consequently
the same. But by what methods they have prosecuted
their intention, is farther to be considered.
Satire is of the nature of moral philosophy, as being
instructive: he, therefore, who instructs most usefully,
will carry the palm from his two antagonists.
The philosophy in which Persius was educated, and
which he professes through his whole book, is the
Stoick; the most noble, most generous, most beneficial
to human kind, amongst all the sects, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
have given us the rules of ethics, thereby to form
a severe virtue in the soul; to raise in us an undaunted
courage against the assaults of fortune;
to esteem as nothing the things that are without
us, because they are not in our power; not to value
riches, beauty, honours, fame, or health, any farther
than as conveniencies, and so many helps to living
as we ought, and doing good in our generation: in
short, to be always happy, while we possess our
minds with a good conscience, are free from the
slavery of vices, and conform our actions and conversations
to the rules of right reason. See here,
my lord, an epitome of Epictetus; the doctrine of
Zeno, and the education of our Persius: and this
he expressed, not only in all his satires, but in the
manner of his life. I will not lessen this commendation
of the Stoick philosophy, by giving you an
account of some absurdities in their doctrine, and
some perhaps impieties, if we consider them by the
standard of christian faith. Persius has fallen into
none of them; and therefore is free from those imputations.
What he teaches might be taught from
pulpits, with more profit to the audience, than all
the nice speculations of divinity, and controversies
concerning faith; which are more for the profit of
the shepherd, than for the edification of the flock.
Passions, interest, ambition, and all their bloody
consequences of discord, and of war, are banished
from this doctrine. Here is nothing proposed but
the quiet and tranquillity of the mind; virtue lodged
at home, and afterwards diffused in her general
effects, to the improvement and good of human
kind. And therefore I wonder not that the present
Bishop of Salisbury<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> has recommended this our
author, and the Tenth Satire of Juvenal, in his Pastoral
Letter, to the serious perusal and practice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the divines in his diocese, as the best common-places
for their sermons, as the store-houses and magazines
of moral virtues, from whence they may draw out,
as they have occasion, all manner of assistance for
the accomplishment of a virtuous life, which the
stoicks have assigned for the great end and perfection
of mankind. Herein then it is, that Persius
has excelled both Juvenal and Horace. He sticks
to his own philosophy; he shifts not sides, like
Horace, who is sometimes an Epicurean, sometimes
a Stoick, sometimes an Eclectic, as his present humour
leads him; nor declaims like Juvenal against
vices, more like an orator, than a philosopher. Persius
is every where the same; true to the dogmas
of his master. What he has learnt, he teaches vehemently;
and what he teaches, that he practises
himself. There is a spirit of sincerity in all he says;
you may easily discern that he is in earnest, and is
persuaded of that truth which he inculcates. In
this I am of opinion that he excels Horace, who is
commonly in jest, and laughs while he instructs;
and is equal to Juvenal, who was as honest and serious
as Persius, and more he could not be.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have followed Casaubon, and enlarged
upon him, because I am satisfied that he says
no more than truth; the rest is almost all frivolous.
For he says that Horace, being the son of a tax-gatherer,
or a collector, as we call it, smells every
where of the meanness of his birth and education:
his conceipts are vulgar, like the subjects of his
satires; that he does <i>plebeium sapere</i>, and writes
not with that elevation, which becomes a sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>irist:
that Persius, being nobly born, and of an opulent
family, had likewise the advantage of a better master;
Cornutus being the most learned of his time,
a man of the most holy life, the chief of the Stoick
sect at Rome, and not only a great philosopher,
but a poet himself, and in probability a coadjutor
of Persius: that, as for Juvenal, he was long a
declaimer, came late to poetry, and has not been
much conversant in philosophy.</p>

<p>It is granted that the father of Horace was <i>libertinus</i>,
that is, one degree removed from his grandfather,
who had been once a slave. But Horace,
speaking of him, gives him the best character of a
father, which I ever read in history; and I wish a
witty friend of mine, now living, had such another.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
He bred him in the best school, and with the best
company of young noblemen; and Horace, by his
gratitude to his memory, gives a certain testimony
that his education was ingenuous. After this, he formed
himself abroad, by the conversation of great men.
Brutus found him at Athens, and was so pleased
with him, that he took him thence into the army,
and made him <i>tribunus militum</i>, a colonel in a
legion, which was the preferment of an old soldier.
All this was before his acquaintance with Mec&aelig;nas,
and his introduction into the court of Augustus,
and the familiarity of that great emperor; which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>had he not been well-bred before, had been enough
to civilize his conversation, and render him accomplished
and knowing in all the arts of complacency
and good behaviour; and, in short, an agreeable
companion for the retired hours and privacies of a
favourite, who was first minister. So that, upon
the whole matter, Persius may be acknowledged to
be equal with him in those respects, though better
born, and Juvenal inferior to both. If the advantage
be any where, it is on the side of Horace; as
much as the court of Augustus C&aelig;sar was superior
to that of Nero. As for the subjects which they
treated, it will appear hereafter, that Horace writ
not vulgarly on vulgar subjects, nor always chose
them. His style is constantly accommodated to his
subject, either high or low. If his fault be too much
lowness, that of Persius is the fault of the hardness
of his metaphors, and obscurity: and so they are
equal in the failings of their style; where Juvenal
manifestly triumphs over both of them.</p>

<p>The comparison betwixt Horace and Juvenal is
more difficult; because their forces were more
equal. A dispute has always been, and ever will
continue, betwixt the favourers of the two poets.
<i>Non nostrum est tantas componere lites.</i> I shall only
venture to give my own opinion, and leave it for better
judges to determine. If it be only argued in general,
which of them was the better poet, the victory
is already gained on the side of Horace. Virgil himself
must yield to him in the delicacy of his turns,
his choice of words, and perhaps the purity of his
Latin. He who says that Pindar is inimitable, is
himself inimitable in his Odes. But the contention
betwixt these two great masters, is for the prize of
Satire; in which controversy, all the Odes and
Epodes of Horace are to stand excluded. I say this,
because Horace has written many of them satyrically,
against his private enemies; yet these, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
justly considered, are somewhat of the nature of
the Greek Silli, which were invectives against particular
sects and persons. But Horace has purged
himself of this choler, before he entered on those
discourses, which are more properly called the
Roman Satire. He has not now to do with a Lyce,
a Canidia, a Cassius Severus, or a Menas; but is to
correct the vices and the follies of his time, and to
give the rules of a happy and virtuous life. In a
word, that former sort of satire, which is known in
England by the name of lampoon, is a dangerous
sort of weapon, and for the most part unlawful.
We have no moral right on the reputation of other
men. It is taking from them what we cannot restore
to them. There are only two reasons, for
which we may be permitted to write lampoons;
and I will not promise that they can always justify
us. The first is revenge, when we have been affronted
in the same nature, or have been any ways
notoriously abused, and can make ourselves no
other reparation. And yet we know, that, in christian
charity, all offences are to be forgiven, as we
expect the like pardon for those which we daily
commit against Almighty God. And this consideration
has often made me tremble when I was saying
our Saviour's prayer; for the plain condition of
the forgiveness which we beg, is the pardoning of
others the offences which they have done to us;
for which reason I have many times avoided the
commission of that fault, even when I have been
notoriously provoked. Let not this, my lord, pass
for vanity in me; for it is truth. More libels have
been written against me, than almost any man now
living; and I had reason on my side, to have defended
my own innocence. I speak not of my
poetry, which I have wholly given up to the cri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>tics:
let them use it as they please: posterity, perhaps,
may be more favourable to me; for interest
and passion will lie buried in another age, and partiality
and prejudice be forgotten. I speak of my
morals, which have been sufficiently aspersed: that
only sort of reputation ought to be dear to every
honest man, and is to me. But let the world witness
for me, that I have been often wanting to myself
in that particular; I have seldom answered any
scurrilous lampoon, when it was in my power to
have exposed my enemies: and, being naturally vindicative,
have suffered in silence, and possessed my
soul in quiet.</p>

<p>Any thing, though never so little, which a man
speaks of himself, in my opinion, is still too much;
and therefore I will wave this subject, and proceed
to give the second reason which may justify a poet
when he writes against a particular person; and
that is, when he is become a public nuisance. All
those, whom Horace in his Satires, and Persius and
Juvenal have mentioned in theirs, with a brand of
infamy, are wholly such. It is an action of virtue
to make examples of vicious men. They may and
ought to be upbraided with their crimes and follies;
both for their amendment, if they are not yet incorrigible,
and for the terror of others, to hinder
them from falling into those enormities, which they
see are so severely punished in the persons of others.
The first reason was only an excuse for revenge;
but this second is absolutely of a poet's office to
perform: but how few lampooners are now living,
who are capable of this duty!<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> When they come
in my way, it is impossible sometimes to avoid reading
them. But, good God! how remote they are,
in common justice, from the choice of such persons
as are the proper subject of satire! And how little
wit they bring for the support of their injusti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>ce!
The weaker sex is their most ordinary theme; and
the best and fairest are sure to be the most severely
handled. Amongst men, those who are prosperously
unjust, are entitled to panegyric; but afflicted
virtue is insolently stabbed with all manner of
reproaches; no decency is considered, no fulsomeness
omitted; no venom is wanting, as far as dulness
can supply it: for there is a perpetual dearth
of wit; a barrenness of good sense and entertainment.
The neglect of the readers will soon put an
end to this sort of scribbling. There can be no
pleasantry where there is no wit; no impression
can be made, where there is no truth for the foundation.
To conclude: they are like the fruits of
the earth in this unnatural season; the corn which
held up its head is spoiled with rankness; but the
greater part of the harvest is laid along, and little
of good income and wholesome nourishment is received
into the barns. This is almost a digression,
I confess to your lordship; but a just indignation
forced it from me. Now I have removed this rubbish,
I will return to the comparison of Juvenal
and Horace.</p>

<p>I would willingly divide the palm betwixt them,
upon the two heads of profit and delight, which are
the two ends of poetry in general. It must be
granted, by the favourers of Juvenal, that Horace
is the more copious and profitable in his instructions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>of human life; but, in my particular opinion,
which I set not up for a standard to better judgements,
Juvenal is the more delightful author. I
am profited by both, I am pleased with both; but
I owe more to Horace for my instruction, and more
to Juvenal for my pleasure. This, as I said, is my
particular taste of these two authors: they who
will have either of them to excel the other in both
qualities, can scarce give better reasons for their
opinion than I for mine. But all unbiassed readers
will conclude, that my moderation is not to be condemned:
to such impartial men I must appeal; for
they who have already formed their judgment, may
justly stand suspected of prejudice; and though
all who are my readers will set up to be my judges,
I enter my <i>caveat</i> against them, that they ought
not so much as to be of my jury; or, if they be admitted,
it is but reason that they should first hear
what I have to urge in the defence of my opinion.</p>

<p>That Horace is somewhat the better instructor of
the two, is proved from hence,&mdash;that his instructions
are more general, Juvenal's more limited. So that,
granting that the counsels which they give are
equally good for moral use, Horace, who gives the
most various advice, and most applicable to all occasions
which can occur to us in the course of our
lives,&mdash;as including in his discourses, not only all the
rules of morality, but also of civil conversation,&mdash;is
undoubtedly to be preferred to him who is more
circumscribed in his instructions, makes them to
fewer people, and on fewer occasions, than the
other. I may be pardoned for using an old saying,
since it is true, and to the purpose: <i>Bonum qu&ograve; communis,</i>
<i>e&ograve; melius</i>. Juvenal, excepting only his first
Satire, is in all the rest confined to the exposing of
some particular vice; that he lashes, and there he
sticks. His sentences are truly shining and instructive;
but they are sprinkled here and there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Horace is teaching us in every line, and is perpetually
moral: he had found out the skill of Virgil,
to hide his sentences; to give you the virtue of
them, without shewing them in their full extent;
which is the ostentation of a poet, and not his art:
and this Petronius charges on the authors of his
time, as a vice of writing which was then growing
on the age: <i>ne sententi&aelig; extra corpus orationis</i>
<i>emineant</i>: he would have them weaved into the body
of the work, and not appear embossed upon it,
and striking directly on the reader's view. Folly
was the proper quarry of Horace, and not vice;
and as there are but few notoriously wicked men,
in comparison with a shoal of fools and fops, so it
is a harder thing to make a man wise than to make
him honest; for the will is only to be reclaimed in
the one, but the understanding is to be informed
in the other. There are blind sides and follies,
even in the professors of moral philosophy; and
there is not any one sect of them that Horace has
not exposed: which, as it was not the design of
Juvenal, who was wholly employed in lashing vices,
some of them the most enormous that can be
imagined, so, perhaps, it was not so much his talent.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tangit, et admissus circum pr&aelig;cordia ludit.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This was the commendation which Persius gave him:
where, by <i>vitium</i>, he means those little vices which
we call follies, the defects of human understanding,
or, at most, the peccadillos of life, rather than the
tragical vices, to which men are hurried by their unruly
passions and exorbitant desires. But, in the
word <i>omne</i>, which is universal, he concludes with
me, that the divine wit of Horace left nothing untouched;
that he entered into the inmost recesses
of nature; found out the imperfections even of the
most wise and grave, as well as of the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
people; discovering, even in the great Trebatius,
to whom he addresses the first Satire, his hunting
after business, and following the court, as well as
in the persecutor Crispinus, his impertinence and
importunity. It is true, he exposes Crispinus openly,
as a common nuisance; but he rallies the other,
as a friend, more finely. The exhortations of Persius
are confined to noblemen; and the stoick philosophy
is that alone which he recommends to
them; Juvenal exhorts to particular virtues, as they
are opposed to those vices against which he declaims;
but Horace laughs to shame all follies, and
insinuates virtue, rather by familiar examples than
by the severity of precepts.</p>

<p>This last consideration seems to incline the balance
on the side of Horace, and to give him the
preference to Juvenal, not only in profit, but in
pleasure. But, after all, I must confess, that the
delight which Horace gives me is but languishing.
Be pleased still to understand, that I speak of my
own taste only: he may ravish other men; but I
am too stupid and insensible to be tickled. Where
he barely grins himself, and, as Scaliger says, only
shows his white teeth, he cannot provoke me to any
laughter. His urbanity, that is, his good manners,
are to be commended, but his wit is faint; and his
salt, if I may dare to say so, almost insipid. Juvenal
is of a more vigorous and masculine wit; he gives me
as much pleasure as I can bear; he fully satisfies my
expectation; he treats his subject home: his spleen is
raised, and he raises mine: I have the pleasure of
concernment in all he says; he drives his reader
along with him; and when he is at the end of his
way, I willingly stop with him. If he went another
stage, it would be too far; it would make a journey
of a progress, and turn delight into fatigue. When
he gives over, it is a sign the subject is exhaust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>ed,
and the wit of man can carry it no farther. If a
fault can be justly found in him, it is, that he is
sometimes too luxuriant, too redundant; says more
than he needs, like my friend the <i>Plain-Dealer</i>,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
but never more than pleases. Add to this, that his
thoughts are as just as those of Horace, and much
more elevated. His expressions are sonorous and
more noble; his verse more numerous, and his
words are suitable to his thoughts, sublime and
lofty. All these contribute to the pleasure of the
reader; and the greater the soul of him who reads,
his transports are the greater. Horace is always
on the amble, Juvenal on the gallop; but his way
is perpetually on carpet-ground. He goes with
more impetuosity than Horace, but as securely;
and the swiftness adds a more lively agitation to
the spirits. The low style of Horace is according to
his subject, that is, generally grovelling. I question
not but he could have raised it; for the first epistle
of the second book, which he writes to Augustus,
(a most instructive satire concerning poetry,) is of
so much dignity in the words, and of so much elegancy
in the numbers, that the author plainly
shows, the <i>sermo pedestris</i>, in his other Satires, was
rather his choice than his necessity. He was a rival
to Lucilius, his predecessor, and was resolved to
surpass him in his own manner. Lucilius, as we
see by his remaining fragments, minded neither his
style, nor his numbers, nor his purity of words, nor
his run of verse. Horace therefore copes with him
in that humble way of satire, writes under his own
force, and carries a dead-weight, that he may match
his competitor in the race. This, I imagine, was
the chief reason why he minded only the clearness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>of his satire, and the cleanness of expression, without
ascending to those heights to which his own
vigour might have carried him. But, limiting his
desires only to the conquest of Lucilius, he had his
ends of his rival, who lived before him; but made
way for a new conquest over himself, by Juvenal,
his successor. He could not give an equal pleasure
to his reader, because he used not equal instruments.
The fault was in the tools, and not in the
workman. But versification and numbers are the
greatest pleasures of poetry: Virgil knew it, and practised
both so happily, that, for aught I know, his
greatest excellency is in his diction. In all other
parts of poetry, he is faultless; but in this he placed
his chief perfection. And give me leave, my lord,
since I have here an apt occasion, to say, that Virgil
could have written sharper satires than either Horace
or Juvenal, if he would have employed his talent that
way. I will produce a verse and half of his, in one
of his Eclogues, to justify my opinion; and with
commas after every word, to show, that he has given
almost as many lashes as he has written syllables:
it is against a bad poet, whose ill verses he
describes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----<i>non tu, in triviis, indocte, solebas</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Stridenti, miserum, stipul&acirc;, disperdere carmen?</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, to return to my purpose. When there is any
thing deficient in numbers and sound, the reader is
uneasy and unsatisfied; he wants something of his
complement, desires somewhat which he finds not:
and this being the manifest defect of Horace, it is
no wonder that, finding it supplied in Juvenal, we
are more delighted with him. And, besides this, the
sauce of Juvenal is more poignant, to create in us
an appetite of reading him. The meat of Horace
is more nourishing; but the cookery of Juvenal
more exquisite: so that, granting Horace to be the
more general philosopher, we cannot deny that Juven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>al
was the greater poet, I mean in satire. His
thoughts are sharper; his indignation against vice
is more vehement; his spirit has more of the commonwealth
genius; he treats tyranny, and all the
vices attending it, as they deserve, with the utmost
rigour: and consequently, a noble soul is better
pleased with a zealous vindicator of Roman liberty,
than with a temporising poet, a well-mannered
court-slave, and a man who is often afraid of laughing
in the right place; who is ever decent, because
he is naturally servile. After all, Horace had the
disadvantage of the times in which he lived; they
were better for the man, but worse for the satirist.
It is generally said, that those enormous vices
which were practised under the reign of Domitian,
were unknown in the time of Augustus C&aelig;sar;
that therefore Juvenal had a larger field than Horace.
Little follies were out of doors, when oppression
was to be scourged instead of avarice: it
was no longer time to turn into ridicule the false
opinions of philosophers, when the Roman liberty
was to be asserted. There was more need of a Brutus
in Domitian's days, to redeem or mend, than of
a Horace, if he had then been living, to laugh at a
fly-catcher.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> This reflection at the same time excuses
Horace, but exalts Juvenal.&mdash;I have ended,
before I was aware, the comparison of Horace and
Juvenal, upon the topics of instruction and delight;
and, indeed, I may safely here conclude that common-place;
for, if we make Horace our minister of
state in satire, and Juvenal of our private pleasures,
I think the latter has no ill bargain of it. Let pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>fit
have the pre-eminence of honour, in the end of
poetry. Pleasure, though but the second in degree,
is the first in favour. And who would not
chuse to be loved better, rather than to be more
esteemed? But I am entered already upon another
topic, which concerns the particular merits of these
two satirists. However, I will pursue my business
where I left it, and carry it farther than that common
observation of the several ages in which these
authors flourished.</p>

<p>When Horace writ his Satires, the monarchy
of his C&aelig;sar was in its newness, and the government
but just made easy to the conquered
people. They could not possibly have forgotten
the usurpation of that prince upon their freedom,
nor the violent methods which he had used, in the
compassing that vast design: they yet remembered
his proscriptions, and the slaughter of so many
noble Romans, their defenders: amongst the rest,
that horrible action of his, when he forced Livia
from the arms of her husband, who was constrained
to see her married, as Dion relates the story,
and, big with child as she was, conveyed to the
bed of his insulting rival. The same Dion Cassius
gives us another instance of the crime before mentioned;
that Cornelius Sisenna being reproached,
in full senate, with the licentious conduct of his
wife, returned this answer, "that he had married
her by the counsel of Augustus;" intimating, says
my author, that Augustus had obliged him to that
marriage, that he might, under that covert, have
the more free access to her. His adulteries were
still before their eyes: but they must be patient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>where they had not power. In other things that
emperor was moderate enough: propriety was generally
secured; and the people entertained with
public shows and donatives, to make them more
easily digest their lost liberty. But Augustus, who
was conscious to himself of so many crimes which
he had committed, thought, in the first place, to
provide for his own reputation, by making an edict
against Lampoons and Satires, and the authors of
those defamatory writings, which my author Tacitus,
from the law-term, calls <i>famosos libellos</i>.</p>

<p>In the first book of his Annals, he gives the following
account of it, in these words: <i>Primus Augustus</i>
<i>cognitionem de famosis libellis, specie legis ejus,</i>
<i>tractavit; commotus Cassii Severi libidine, qu&acirc; viros</i>
<i>f&aelig;minasque illustres, procacibus scriptis diffamaverat</i>.
Thus in English: "Augustus was the first, who
under the colour of that law took cognisance of
lampoons; being provoked to it, by the petulancy
of Cassius Severus, who had defamed many illustrious
persons of both sexes, in his writings." The
law to which Tacitus refers, was <i>Lex l&aelig;s&aelig; Majestatis</i>;
commonly called, for the sake of brevity,
<i>Majestas</i>; or, as we say, high treason. He means
not, that this law had not been enacted formerly:
for it had been made by the Decemviri, and was
inscribed amongst the rest in the Twelve Tables; to
prevent the aspersion of the Roman majesty, either
of the people themselves, or their religion, or their
magistrates: and the infringement of it was capital;
that is, the offender was whipt to death, with
the <i>fasces</i>, which were borne before their chief officers
of Rome. But Augustus was the first, who
restored that intermitted law. By the words, <i>under</i>
<i>colour of that law</i>, he insinuates that Augustus
caused it to be executed, on pretence of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
libels, which were written by Cassius Severus,
against the nobility; but, in truth, to save himself
from such defamatory verses. Suetonius likewise
makes mention of it thus: <i>Sparsos de se in curi&acirc;</i>
<i>famosos libellos, nec expavit, et magn&acirc; cur&acirc; redarguit.</i>
<i>Ac ne requisitis quidem auctoribus, id modo censuit,</i>
<i>cognoscendum posthac de iis qui libellos aut carmina</i>
<i>ad infamiam cujuspiam sub alieno nomine edant</i>. "Augustus
was not afraid of libels," says that author;
"yet he took all care imaginable to have them answered;
and then decreed, that for the time to
come, the authors of them should be punished."
But Aurelius makes it yet more clear, according to
my sense, that this emperor for his own sake durst
not permit them: <i>Fecit id Augustus in speciem, et</i>
<i>quasi gratificaretur populo Romano, et primoribus urbis;</i>
<i>sed revera ut sibi consuleret: nam habuit in animo,</i>
<i>comprimere nimiam quorundam procacitatem in</i>
<i>loquendo, &agrave; qu&acirc; nec ipse exemptus fuit. Nam suo</i>
<i>nomine compescere erat invidiosum, sub alieno facile et</i>
<i>utile. Ergo specie legis tractavit, quasi populi Romani</i>
<i>majestas infamaretur.</i> This, I think, is a sufficient
comment on that passage of Tacitus. I will
add only by the way, that the whole family of the
C&aelig;sars, and all their relations, were included in the
law; because the majesty of the Romans, in the
time of the empire, was wholly in that house;
<i>omnia C&aelig;sar erat</i>: they were all accounted sacred
who belonged to him. As for Cassius Severus, he
was contemporary with Horace; and was the same
poet against whom he writes in his Epodes, under
this title, <i>In Cassium Severum maledicum poetam</i>;
perhaps intending to kill two crows, according to
our proverb, with one stone, and revenge both himself
and his emperor together.</p>

<p>From hence I may reasonably conclude, that Aug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>ustus,
who was not altogether so good as he was
wise, had some by-respect in the enacting of this
law; for to do any thing for nothing, was not his
maxim. Horace, as he was a courtier, complied
with the interest of his master; and, avoiding the
lashing of greater crimes, confined himself to the
ridiculing of petty vices and common follies; excepting
only some reserved cases, in his Odes and
Epodes, of his own particular quarrels, which either
with permission of the magistrate, or without it,
every man will revenge, though I say not that he
should; for <i>prior l&aelig;sit</i> is a good excuse in the civil
law, if christianity had not taught us to forgive.
However, he was not the proper man to arraign
great vices, at least if the stories which we hear of
him are true,&mdash;that he practised some, which I will
not here mention, out of honour to him. It was
not for a Clodius to accuse adulterers, especially
when Augustus was of that number; so that though
his age was not exempted from the worst of villanies,
there was no freedom left to reprehend
them by reason of the edict; and our poet was not
fit to represent them in an odious character, because
himself was dipt in the same actions. Upon
this account, without farther insisting on the different
tempers of Juvenal and Horace, I conclude,
that the subjects which Horace chose for satire, are
of a lower nature than those of which Juvenal has
written.</p>

<p>Thus I have treated, in a new method, the comparison
betwixt Horace, Juvenal, and Persius;
somewhat of their particular manner belonging to
all of them is yet remaining to be considered. Persius
was grave, and particularly opposed his gravity
to lewdness, which was the predominant vice in
Nero's court, at the time when he published his
Satires, which was before that emperor fell into the
excess of cruelty. Horace was a mild <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>admonisher,
a court-satirist, fit for the gentle times of Augustus,
and more fit, for the reasons which I have already
given. Juvenal was as proper for his times, as they
for theirs; his was an age that deserved a more severe
chastisement; vices were more gross and open,
more flagitious, more encouraged by the example of
a tyrant, and more protected by his authority.
Therefore, wheresoever Juvenal mentions Nero, he
means Domitian, whom he dares not attack in his
own person, but scourges him by proxy. Heinsius
urges in praise of Horace, that, according to the ancient
art and law of satire, it should be nearer to
comedy than tragedy; not declaiming against vice,
but only laughing at it. Neither Persius nor Juvenal
were ignorant of this, for they had both studied
Horace. And the thing itself is plainly true. But
as they had read Horace, they had likewise read
Lucilius, of whom Persius says,&mdash;<i>secuit urbem; ... et</i>
<i>genuinum fregit in illis</i>; meaning Mutius and Lupus;
and Juvenal also mentions him in these words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ense velut stricto, quoties Lucilius ardens</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Infremuit, rubet auditor, cui frigida mens est</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Criminibus, tacit&acirc; sudant pr&aelig;cordia culpa</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So that they thought the imitation of Lucilius
was more proper to their purpose than that of
Horace. "They changed satire, (says Holyday) but
they changed it for the better; for the business
being to reform great vices, chastisement goes
farther than admonition; whereas a perpetual grin,
like that of Horace, does rather anger than amend
a man."</p>

<p>Thus far that learned critic, Barten Holyday,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
whose interpretation and illustrations of Juvenal are
as excellent, as the verse of his translation and his
English are lame and pitiful. For it is not enough
to give us the meaning of a poet, which I acknowledge
him to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>have performed most faithfully, but
he must also imitate his genius, and his numbers, as
far as the English will come up to the elegance of
the original. In few words, it is only for a poet to
translate a poem. Holyday and Stapylton<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> had not
enough considered this, when they attempted Juvenal:
but I forbear reflections; only I beg leave
to take notice of this sentence, where Holyday says,
"a perpetual grin, like that of Horace, rather angers
than amends a man." I cannot give him up
the manner of Horace in low satire so easily. Let
the chastisement of Juvenal be never so necessary
for his new kind of satire; let him declaim as wittily
and sharply as he pleases; yet still the nicest
and most delicate touches of satire consist in fine
raillery. This, my lord, is your particular talent, to
which even Juvenal could not arrive. It is not
reading, it is not imitation of an author, which can
produce this fineness; it must be inborn; it must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>proceed from a genius, and particular way of thinking,
which is not to be taught; and therefore not
to be imitated by him who has it not from nature.
How easy is it to call rogue and villain, and that
wittily! But how hard to make a man appear a fool,
a blockhead, or a knave, without using any of those
opprobrious terms! To spare the grossness of the
names, and to do the thing yet more severely, is to
draw a full face, and to make the nose and cheeks
stand out, and yet not to employ any depth of shadowing.
This is the mystery of that noble trade,
which yet no master can teach to his apprentice;
he may give the rules, but the scholar is never the
nearer in his practice. Neither is it true, that this
fineness of raillery is offensive. A witty man is
tickled while he is hurt in this manner, and a fool
feels it not. The occasion of an offence may possibly
be given, but he cannot take it. If it be
granted, that in effect this way does more mischief;
that a man is secretly wounded, and though he be
not sensible himself, yet the malicious world will
find it out for him; yet there is still a vast difference
betwixt the slovenly butchering of a man,
and the fineness of a stroke that separates the head
from the body, and leaves it standing in its place.
A man may be capable, as Jack Ketch's<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> wife said
of his servant, of a plain piece of work, a bare
hanging; but to make a malefactor die sweetly,
was only belonging to her husband. I wish I could
apply it to myself, if the reader would be kind
enough to think it belongs to me. The character
of Zimri in my "Absalom," is, in my opinion, worth
the whole poem: it is not bloody, but it is ridiculous
enough; and he, for whom it was intended,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>was too witty to resent it as an injury.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> If I had
railed, I might have suffered for it justly; but I
managed my own work more happily, perhaps more
dexterously. I avoided the mention of great crimes,
and applied myself to the representing of blind-sides,
and little extravagancies; to which, the wittier
a man is, he is generally the more obnoxious.
It succeeded as I wished; the jest went round, and
he was laughed at in his turn who began the frolic.</p>

<p>And thus, my lord, you see I have preferred the
manner of Horace, and of your lordship, in this
kind of satire, to that of Juvenal, and I think, reasonably.
Holyday ought not to have arraigned so
great an author, for that which was his excellency
and his merit: or if he did, on such a palpable mistake,
he might expect that some one might possibly
arise, either in his own time, or after him, to
rectify his error, and restore to Horace that commendation,
of which he has so unjustly robbed him.
And let the manes of Juvenal forgive me, if I say,
that this way of Horace was the best for amending
manners, as it is the most difficult. His was an
<i>ense rescindendum</i>; but that of Horace was a pleasant
cure, with all the limbs preserved entire;
and, as our mountebanks tell us in their bills, without
keeping the patient within doors for a day.
What they promise only, Horace has effectually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>performed: yet I contradict not the proposition
which I formerly advanced. Juvenal's times required
a more painful kind of operation; but if he
had lived in the age of Horace, I must needs affirm,
that he had it not about him. He took the method
which was prescribed him by his own genius, which
was sharp and eager; he could not rally, but he
could declaim; and as his provocations were great,
he has revenged them tragically. This notwithstanding,
I am to say another word, which, as true
as it is, will yet displease the partial admirers of our
Horace. I have hinted it before, but it is time for
me now to speak more plainly.</p>

<p>This manner of Horace is indeed the best; but
Horace has not executed it altogether so happily,
at least not often. The manner of Juvenal is confessed
to be inferior to the former, but Juvenal has
excelled him in his performance. Juvenal has railed
more wittily than Horace has rallied. Horace means
to make his readers laugh, but he is not sure of his
experiment. Juvenal always intends to move your
indignation, and he always brings about his purpose.
Horace, for aught I know, might have tickled
the people of his age; but amongst the moderns
he is not so successful. They, who say he
entertains so pleasantly, may perhaps value themselves
on the quickness of their own understandings,
that they can see a jest farther off than other
men; they may find occasion of laughter in the
wit-battle of the two buffoons, Sarmentus and Cicerrus;
and hold their sides for fear of bursting,
when Rupilius and Persius are scolding. For my
own part, I can only like the characters of all four,
which are judiciously given; but for my heart I
cannot so much as smile at their insipid raillery. I
see not why Persius should call upon Brutus to revenge
him on his adversary; and that because he
had killed Julius C&aelig;sar, for endeavouring to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> a
king, therefore he should be desired to murder Rupilius,
only because his name was Mr King.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> A
miserable clench, in my opinion, for Horace to record:
I have heard honest Mr Swan<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> make many
a better, and yet have had the grace to hold my
countenance. But it may be puns were then in
fashion, as they were wit in the sermons of the last
age, and in the court of King Charles II. I am
sorry to say it, for the sake of Horace; but certain
it is, he has no fine palate who can feed so heartily
on garbage.</p>

<p>But I have already wearied myself, and doubt not
but I have tired your lordship's patience, with this
long, rambling, and, I fear, trivial discourse. Upon
the one half of the merits, that is, pleasure, I cannot
but conclude that Juvenal was the better satirist.
They, who will descend into his particular
praises, may find them at large in the Dissertation
of the learned Rigaltius to Thuanus. As for Persius,
I have given the reasons why I think him inferior
to both of them; yet I have one thing to add
on that subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>Barten Holyday, who translated both Juvenal and
Persius, has made this distinction betwixt them,
which is no less true than witty,&mdash;that in Persius the
difficulty is to find a meaning, in Juvenal to chuse
a meaning: so crabbed is Persius, and so copious is
Juvenal; so much the understanding is employed
in one, and so much the judgment in the other;
so difficult it is to find any sense in the former, and
the best sense of the latter.</p>

<p>If, on the other side, any one suppose I have
commended Horace below his merit, when I have
allowed him but the second place, I desire him to
consider, if Juvenal, a man of excellent natural endowments,
besides the advantages of diligence and
study, and coming after him, and building upon his
foundations, might not probably, with all these
helps, surpass him; and whether it be any dishonour
to Horace to be thus surpassed, since no art or
science is at once begun and perfected, but that it
must pass first through many hands, and even through
several ages. If Lucilius could add to Ennius, and
Horace to Lucilius, why, without any diminution to
the fame of Horace, might not Juvenal give the last
perfection to that work? Or, rather, what disreputation
is it to Horace, that Juvenal excels in the
tragical satire, as Horace does in the comical? I
have read over attentively both Heinsius and Dacier,
in their commendations of Horace; but I can
find no more in either of them, for the preference
of him to Juvenal, than the instructive part; the
part of wisdom, and not that of pleasure; which,
therefore, is here allowed him, notwithstanding what
Scaliger and Rigaltius have pleaded to the contrary
for Juvenal. And, to show that I am impartial, I
will here translate what Dacier has said on that subject.</p>

<p>"I cannot give a more just idea of the two books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
of Satires made by Horace, than by comparing them
to the statues of the Sileni, to which Alcibiades compares
Socrates in the Symposium. They were figures,
which had nothing of agreeable, nothing of beauty,
on their outside; but when any one took the pains
to open them, and search into them, he there found
the figures of all the deities. So, in the shape that
Horace presents himself to us in his Satires, we see
nothing, at the first view, which deserves our attention:
it seems that he is rather an amusement for
children, than for the serious consideration of men.
But, when we take away his crust, and that which
hides him from our sight, when we discover him to
the bottom, then we find all the divinities in a full
assembly; that is to say, all the virtues which ought
to be the continual exercise of those, who seriously
endeavour to correct their vices."</p>

<p>It is easy to observe, that Dacier, in this noble similitude,
has confined the praise of his author wholly
to the instructive part; the commendation turns
on this, and so does that which follows.</p>

<p>"In these two books of satire, it is the business of
Horace to instruct us how to combat our vices, to
regulate our passions, to follow nature, to give
bounds to our desires, to distinguish betwixt truth
and falsehood, and betwixt our conceptions of things,
and things themselves; to come back from our prejudicate
opinions, to understand exactly the principles
and motives of all our actions; and to avoid
the ridicule, into which all men necessarily fall, who
are intoxicated with those notions which they have
received from their masters, and which they obstinately
retain, without examining whether or no
they be founded on right reason.</p>

<p>"In a word, he labours to render us happy in relation
to ourselves; agreeable and faithful to our
friends; and discreet, serviceable, and well-bre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>d, in
relation to those with whom we are obliged to live,
and to converse. To make his figures intelligible,
to conduct his readers through the labyrinth of some
perplexed sentence, or obscure parenthesis, is no
great matter; and, as Epictetus says, there is nothing
of beauty in all this, or what is worthy of a
prudent man. The principal business, and which is
of most importance to us, is to show the use, the
reason, and the proof of his precepts.</p>

<p>"They who endeavour not to correct themselves,
according to so exact a model, are just like the patients
who have open before them a book of admirable
receipts for their diseases, and please themselves
with reading it, without comprehending the
nature of the remedies, or how to apply them to
their cure."</p>

<p>Let Horace go off with these encomiums, which
he has so well deserved.</p>

<p>To conclude the contention betwixt our three
poets, I will use the words of Virgil, in his fifth
&AElig;neid, where &AElig;neas proposes the rewards of the foot-race
to the three first who should reach the goal.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">&mdash;&mdash;<i>Tres pr&aelig;mia primi</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Accipient, flav&acirc;que caput nectentur oliv&acirc;.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Let these three ancients be preferred to all the moderns,
as first arriving at the goal; let them all be
crowned, as victors, with the wreath that properly
belongs to satire; but, after that, with this distinction
amongst themselves,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Primus equum phaleris insignem victor habeto.</i>
</p>

<p>Let Juvenal ride first in triumph;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Alter Amazoniam pharetram, plenamque sagittis</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Threiciis, lato quam circumplectitur auro</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Balteus, et tereti subnectit fibula gemm&acirc;.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Let Horace, who is the second, and but just the second,
carry off the quivers and the arrows, as the
badges of his satire, and the golden belt, and the
diamond button;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tertius Argolico hoc clypeo contentus abito.</i>
</p>

<p>And let Persius, the last of the first three worthies,
be contented with this Grecian shield, and with
victory, not only over all the Grecians, who were
ignorant of the Roman satire, but over all the moderns
in succeeding ages, excepting Boileau and
your lordship.</p>

<p>And thus I have given the history of Satire, and
derived it as far as from Ennius to your lordship; that
is, from its first rudiments of barbarity to its last polishing
and perfection; which is, with Virgil, in his
address to Augustus,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----<i>Nomen fam&acirc; tot ferre per annos,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tithoni prim&acirc; quot abest ab origine C&aelig;sar.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I said only from Ennius; but I may safely carry it
higher, as far as Livius Andronicus, who, as I have
said formerly, taught the first play at Rome, in the
year <i>ab urbe condita</i> <span class="smcap">CCCCCXIV.</span> I have since desired
my learned friend, Mr Maidwell,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> to compute
the difference of times, betwixt Aristophanes and
Livius Andronicus; and he assures me, from the
best chronologers, that "Plutus," the last of Aristophanes's
plays, was represented at Athens, in the
year of the 97th Olympiad; which agrees with the
year <i>urbis condit&aelig;</i> <span class="smcap">CCCLXIV.</span> So that the difference
of years betwixt Aristophanes and Andronicus is
150; from whence I have probably deduced, that
Livius Andronicus, who was a Grecian, had read
the plays of the old comedy, which were satirical,
and also of the new; for Menander was fifty years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>before him, which must needs be a great light to
him in his own plays, that were of the satirical nature.
That the Romans had farces before this it is
true; but then they had no communication with
Greece; so that Andronicus was the first who wrote
after the manner of the old comedy in his plays:
he was imitated by Ennius, about thirty years afterwards.
Though the former writ fables, the latter,
speaking properly, began the Roman satire; according
to that description, which Juvenal gives of
it in his first:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Quicquid agunt homines, votum, timor, ira, voluptas,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Gaudia, discursus, nostri est farrago libelli.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is that in which I have made bold to differ
from Casaubon, Rigaltius, Dacier, and indeed from
all the modern critics,&mdash;that not Ennius, but Andronicus
was the first, who, by the <i>Arch&aelig;a Com&oelig;dia</i>
of the Greeks, added many beauties to the
first rude and barbarous Roman satire: which sort
of poem, though we had not derived from Rome,
yet nature teaches it mankind in all ages, and in
every country.</p>

<p>It is but necessary, that after so much has been
said of Satire, some definition of it should be given.
Heinsius, in his "Dissertations on Horace," makes
it for me, in these words: "Satire is a kind of poetry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>without a series of action, invented for the purging
of our minds; in which human vices, ignorance,
and errors, and all things besides, which are produced
from them in every man, are severely reprehended;
partly dramatically, partly simply, and
sometimes in both kinds of speaking; but, for the
most part, figuratively, and occultly; consisting in
a low familiar way, chiefly in a sharp and pungent
manner of speech; but partly, also, in a facetious
and civil way of jesting; by which either hatred, or
laughter, or indignation, is moved."&mdash;Where I cannot
but observe, that this obscure and perplexed
definition, or rather description, of satire, is wholly
accommodated to the Horatian way; and excluding
the works of Juvenal and Persius, as foreign from
that kind of poem. The clause in the beginning of
it ("without a series of action") distinguishes satire
properly from stage-plays, which are all of one action,
and one continued series of action. The end
or scope of satire is to purge the passions; so far it
is common to the satires of Juvenal and Persius.
The rest which follows is also generally belonging
to all three; till he comes upon us, with the excluding
clause&mdash;"consisting in a low familiar way of
speech,"&mdash;which is the proper character of Horace;
and from which, the other two, for their honour be
it spoken, are far distant. But how come lowness
of style, and the familiarity of words, to be so much
the propriety of satire, that without them a poet can
be no more a satirist, than without risibility he can
be a man? Is the fault of Horace to be made the
virtue and standing rule of this poem? Is the <i>grande</i>
<i>sophos</i><a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> of Persius, and the sublimity of Juvenal, to
be circumscribed with the meanness of words and
vulgarity of expression? If Horace refused the
pains of numbers, and the loftiness of figures, are
they bound to follow so ill a precedent? Let him
walk a-foot, with his pad in his hand, for his own
pleasure; but let not them be accounted no poets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>,
who chuse to mount, and show their horsemanship.
Holyday is not afraid to say, that there was never
such a fall, as from his Odes to his Satires, and that
he, injuriously to himself, untuned his harp. The
majestic way of Persius and Juvenal was new when
they began it, but it is old to us; and what poems
have not, with time, received an alteration in their
fashion? "which alteration," says Holyday, "is to
after times as good a warrant as the first." Has not
Virgil changed the manners of Homer's heroes in his
&AElig;neid? Certainly he has, and for the better: for
Virgil's age was more civilized, and better bred;
and he writ according to the politeness of Rome,
under the reign of Augustus C&aelig;sar, not to the rudeness
of Agamemnon's age, or the times of Homer.
Why should we offer to confine free spirits to one
form, when we cannot so much as confine our bodies
to one fashion of apparel? Would not Donne's
satires, which abound with so much wit, appear
more charming, if he had taken care of his words,
and of his numbers? But he followed Horace so very
close, that of necessity he must fall with him;
and I may safely say it of this present age, that if
we are not so great wits as Donne, yet, certainly,
we are better poets.</p>

<p>But I have said enough, and it may be too much,
on this subject. Will your lordship be pleased to
prolong my audience, only so far, till I tell you my
own trivial thoughts, how a modern satire should
be made. I will not deviate in the least from the
precepts and examples of the ancients, who were
always our best masters. I will only illustrate them,
and discover some of the hidden beauties in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>designs, that we thereby may form our own in imitation
of them. Will you please but to observe, that
Persius, the least in dignity of all the three, has notwithstanding
been the first, who has discovered to
us this important secret, in the designing of a perfect
satire,&mdash;that it ought only to treat of one subject;&mdash;to
be confined to one particular theme; or, at
least, to one principally. If other vices occur in the
management of the chief, they should only be transiently
lashed, and not be insisted on, so as to make
the design double. As in a play of the English fashion,
which we call a tragi-comedy, there is to be
but one main design; and though there be an underplot,
or second walk of comical characters and
adventures, yet they are subservient to the chief
fable, carried along under it, and helping to it; so
that the drama may not seem a monster with two
heads. Thus, the Copernican system of the planets
makes the moon to be moved by the motion of the
earth, and carried about her orb, as a dependent of
her's. Mascardi, in his discourse of the <i>Doppia favola</i>,
or double tale in plays, gives an instance of it
in the famous pastoral of Guarini, called <i>Il Pastor</i>
<i>Fido</i>; where Corisca and the Satyr are the under
parts; yet we may observe, that Corisca is brought
into the body of the plot, and made subservient to
it. It is certain, that the divine wit of Horace was
not ignorant of this rule,&mdash;that a play, though it consists
of many parts, must yet be one in the action,
and must drive on the accomplishment of one design;
for he gives this very precept,&mdash;<i>Sit quodvis simplex</i>
<i>duntaxat et unum</i>; yet he seems not much to
mind it in his Satires, many of them consisting of
more arguments than one; and the second without
dependence on the first. Casaubon has observed
this before me, in his preference of Persius to Horace;
and will have his own beloved author to be
the first who found out and introduced this method
of confining himself to one subject. I know it may
be urged in defence of Horace, that this unity is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>t
necessary; because the very word <i>satura</i> signifies
a dish plentifully stored with all variety of fruit and
grains. Yet Juvenal, who calls his poems a <i>farrago</i>,
which is a word of the same signification with
<i>satura</i>, has chosen to follow the same method of
Persius, and not of Horace; and Boileau, whose
example alone is a sufficient authority, has wholly
confined himself, in all his satires, to this unity of
design. That variety, which is not to be found in
any one satire, is, at least, in many, written on several
occasions. And if variety be of absolute necessity
in every one of them, according to the etymology
of the word, yet it may arise naturally from
one subject, as it is diversely treated, in the several
subordinate branches of it, all relating to the chief.
It may be illustrated accordingly with variety of
examples in the subdivisions of it, and with as many
precepts as there are members of it; which, altogether,
may complete that <i>olla</i>, or hotchpotch,
which is properly a satire.</p>

<p>Under this unity of theme, or subject, is comprehended
another rule for perfecting the design of true
satire. The poet is bound, and that <i>ex officio</i>, to give
his reader some one precept of moral virtue, and to
caution him against some one particular vice or folly.
Other virtues, subordinate to the first, may be recommended
under that chief head; and other vices
or follies may be scourged, besides that which he
principally intends. But he is chiefly to inculcate
one virtue, and insist on that. Thus Juvenal, in
every satire excepting the first, ties himself to one
principal instructive point, or to the shunning of
moral evil. Even in the sixth, which seems only
an arraignment of the whole sex of womankind,
there is a latent admonition to avoid ill women, by
showing how very few, who are virtuous and good,
are to be found amongst them. But this, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the wittiest of all his satires, has yet the least
of truth or instruction in it. He has run himself
into his old declamatory way, and almost forgotten
that he was now setting up for a moral poet.</p>

<p>Persius is never wanting to us in some profitable
doctrine, and in exposing the opposite vices to it.
His kind of philosophy is one, which is the stoick;
and every satire is a comment on one particular
dogma of that sect, unless we will except the first,
which is against bad writers; and yet even there
he forgets not the precepts of the Porch. In general,
all virtues are every where to be praised and
recommended to practice; and all vices to be reprehended,
and made either odious or ridiculous;
or else there is a fundamental error in the whole
design.</p>

<p>I have already declared who are the only persons
that are the adequate object of private satire,
and who they are that may properly be exposed by
name for public examples of vices and follies; and
therefore I will trouble your lordship no farther
with them. Of the best and finest manner of satire,
I have said enough in the comparison betwixt Juvenal
and Horace: it is that sharp, well-mannered
way of laughing a folly out of countenance, of
which your lordship is the best master in this age.
I will proceed to the versification, which is most
proper for it, and add somewhat to what I have
said already on that subject. The sort of verse
which is called burlesque, consisting of eight syllables,
or four feet, is that which our excellent Hudibras
has chosen. I ought to have mentioned him
before, when I spoke of Donne: but by a slip of an
old man's memory he was forgotten. The worth
of his poem is too well known to need my commendation,
and he is above my censure. His satire
is of the Varronian kind, though unmixed wi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>th
prose. The choice of his numbers is suitable enough
to his design, as he has managed it; but in any
other hand, the shortness of his verse, and the quick
returns of rhyme, had debased the dignity of style.
And besides, the double rhyme, (a necessary companion
of burlesque writing,) is not so proper for
manly satire; for it turns earnest too much to jest,
and gives us a boyish kind of pleasure. It tickles
aukwardly with a kind of pain, to the best sort of
readers: we are pleased ungratefully, and, if I may
say so, against our liking. We thank him not for
giving us that unseasonable delight, when we know
he could have given us a better, and more solid.
He might have left that task to others, who, not
being able to put in thought, can only make us grin
with the excrescence of a word of two or three syllables
in the close. It is, indeed, below so great a master
to make use of such a little instrument.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> But
his good sense is perpetually shining through all he
writes; it affords us not the time of finding faults.
We pass through the levity of his rhyme, and
are immediately carried into some admirable useful
thought. After all, he has chosen this kind of
verse, and has written the best in it: and had he
taken another, he would always have excelled:
as we say of a court-favourite, that whatsoever his
office be, he still makes it uppermost, and most beneficial
to himself.</p>

<p>The quickness of your imagination, my lord, has
already prevented me; and you know before-hand,
that I would prefer the verse of ten syllables, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>we call the English heroic, to that of eight. This
is truly my opinion; for this sort of number is
more roomy; the thought can turn itself with
greater ease in a larger compass. When the rhyme
comes too thick upon us, it straitens the expression;
we are thinking of the close, when we should
be employed in adorning the thought. It makes a
poet giddy with turning in a space too narrow for
his imagination; he loses many beauties, without
gaining one advantage. For a burlesque rhyme
I have already concluded to be none; or, if it were,
it is more easily purchased in ten syllables than in
eight. In both occasions it is as in a tennis-court,
when the strokes of greater force are given, when
we strike out and play at length. Tassoni and
Boileau have left us the best examples of this way,
in the "Secchia Rapita," and the "Lutrin;" and next
them Merlin Cocaius in his "Baldus." I will speak
only of the two former, because the last is written
in Latin verse. The "Secchia Rapita" is an Italian
poem, a satire of the Varronian kind. It is written
in the stanza of eight, which is their measure
for heroic verse. The words are stately, the numbers
smooth, the turn both of thoughts and words
is happy. The first six lines of the stanza seem majestical
and severe; but the two last turn them all
into a pleasant ridicule. Boileau, if I am not much
deceived, has modelled from hence his famous "Lutrin."
He had read the burlesque poetry of Scarron,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
with some kind of indignation, as witty as it was,
and found nothing in France that was worthy of
his imitation; but he copied the Italian so well,
that his own may pass for an original. He writes
it in the French heroic verse, and calls it an heroic
poem; his subject is trivial, but his verse is noble.
I doubt not but he had Virgil in his eye, for we
find many admirable imitations of him, and some
parodies; as particularly this passage in the fourth
of the &AElig;neids:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Nec tibi diva parens, generis nec Dardanus auctor,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Perfide; sed duris genuit te cautibus horrens</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Caucasus; Hyrcan&aelig;que admor&ucirc;nt ubera tigres</i>:<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which he thus translates, keeping to the words,
but altering the sense:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Non, ton pere a Paris, ne fut point boulanger:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et tu n'es point du sang de Gervais, l'horloger:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ta mere ne fut point la maitresse d'un coch&eacute;;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caucase dans ses flancs te forma d'une roch&eacute;:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Une tigresse affreuse, en quelque antre &eacute;cart&eacute;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Te fit, avec son lait, succer sa cruaut&eacute;.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And, as Virgil in his fourth Georgick, of the Bees,
perpetually raises the lowness of his subject, by the
loftiness of his words, and ennobles it by comparisons
drawn from empires, and from monarchs;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Admiranda tibi levium spectacula rerum,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Magnanimosque duces, totiusque ordine gentis</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Mores et studia, et populos, et pr&oelig;lia dicam.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And again:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>At genus immortale manet; multosque per annos</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Stat fortuna domus, et avi numerantur avorum;</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>we see Boileau pursuing him in the same flights,
and scarcely yielding to his master. This, I think,
my lord, to be the most beautiful, and most noble
kind of satire. Here is the majesty of the heroic,
finely mixed with the venom of the other; and
raising the delight which otherwise would be flat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>and vulgar, by the sublimity of the expression. I
could say somewhat more of the delicacy of this
and some other of his satires; but it might turn to
his prejudice, if it were carried back to France.</p>

<p>I have given your lordship but this bare hint, in what
verse and in what manner this sort of satire may be
best managed. Had I time, I could enlarge on the
beautiful turns of words and thoughts, which are as
requisite in this, as in heroic poetry itself, of which
the satire is undoubtedly a species. With these beautiful
turns, I confess myself to have been unacquainted,
till about twenty years ago, in a conversation
which I had with that noble wit of Scotland, Sir
George Mackenzie,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> he asked me why I did not
imitate in my verses the turns of Mr Waller and
Sir John Denham; of which he repeated many to
me. I had often read with pleasure, and with some
profit, those two fathers of our English poetry; but
had not seriously enough considered those beauties
which give the last perfection to their works. Some
sprinklings of this kind I had also formerly in my
plays; but they were casual, and not designed.
But this hint, thus seasonably given me, first made
me sensible of my own wants, and brought me afterwards
to seek for the supply of them in other
English authors. I looked over the darling of my
youth, the famous Cowley; there I found, instead
of them, the points of wit, and quirks of epigram,
even in the "Davideis," an heroic poem, which is of
an opposite nature to those puerilities; but no elegant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>turns either on the word or on the thought.
Then I consulted a greater genius, (without offence
to the manes of that noble author,) I mean Milton;
but as he endeavours every where to express Homer,
whose age had not arrived to that fineness, I
found in him a true sublimity, lofty thoughts, which
were cloathed with admirable Grecisms, and ancient
words, which he had been digging from the
mines of Chaucer and Spenser, and which, with all
their rusticity, had somewhat of venerable in them.
But I found not there neither that for which I looked.
At last I had recourse to his master, Spenser,
the author of that immortal poem, called the "Fairy
Queen;" and there I met with that which I had
been looking for so long in vain. Spenser had
studied Virgil to as much advantage as Milton had
done Homer; and amongst the rest of his excellencies
had copied that. Looking farther into the
Italian, I found Tasso had done the same; nay
more, that all the sonnets in that language are on
the turn of the first thought; which Mr Walsh, in
his late ingenious preface to his poems, has observed.
In short, Virgil and Ovid are the two principal fountains
of them in Latin poetry. And the French at
this day are so fond of them, that they judge them
to be the first beauties: <i>delicate et bien tourn&eacute;</i>, are
the highest commendations which they bestow, on
somewhat which they think a master-piece.</p>

<p>An example of the turn on words, amongst a
thousand others, is that in the last book of Ovid's
"Metamorphoses:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Heu! quantum scelus est, in viscera, viscera condi!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Congestoque avidum pinguescere corpore corpus;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Alteriusque animantem animantis vivere leto.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>
<p>An example on the turn both of thoughts and
words, is to be found in Catullus, in the complaint
of Ariadne, when she was left by Theseus;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Tum jam nulla viro juranti f&aelig;mina credat;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nulla viri speret sermones esse fideles;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Qui, dum aliquid cupiens animus pr&aelig;gestit apisci,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nil metuunt jurare, nihil promittere parcunt:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sed simul ac cupid&aelig; mentis satiata libido est,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dicta nihil metuere, nihil perjuria curant.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>An extraordinary turn upon the words, is that in
Ovid's "Epistol&aelig; Heroidum," of Sappho to Phaon.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Si, nisi qu&aelig; form&acirc; poterit te digna videri,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nulla futura tua est, nulla futura tua est.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lastly: A turn, which I cannot say is absolutely
on words, for the thought turns with them, is in the
fourth Georgick of Virgil; where Orpheus is to
receive his wife from hell, on express condition not
to look on her till she was come on earth:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>C&ugrave;m subita incautum dementia cepit amantem;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ignoscenda quidem, scirent si ignoscere Manes.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I will not burthen your lordship with more of
them; for I write to a master who understands
them better than myself. But I may safely conclude
them to be great beauties.&mdash;I might descend
also to the mechanic beauties of heroic verse; but
we have yet no English <i>prosodia</i>, not so much as a
tolerable dictionary, or a grammar; so that our language
is in a manner barbarous; and what government
will encourage any one, or more, who are
capable of refining it, I know not: but nothing under
a public expence can go through with it. And
I rather fear a declination of the language, than
hope an advancement of it in the present age.</p>

<p>I am still speaking to you, my lord, though, in
all probability, you are already out of hearing. Nothing,
which my meanness can produce, is worthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
of this long attention. But I am come to the last
petition of Abraham; if there be ten righteous
lines, in this vast preface, spare it for their sake;
and also spare the next city, because it is but a little
one.</p>

<p>I would excuse the performance of this translation,
if it were all my own; but the better, though
not the greater part, being the work of some gentlemen,
who have succeeded very happily in their
undertaking, let their excellencies atone for my
imperfections, and those of my sons. I have perused
some of the satires, which are done by other
hands; and they seem to me as perfect in their
kind, as any thing I have seen in English verse.
The common way which we have taken, is not a
literal translation, but a kind of paraphrase; or
somewhat, which is yet more loose, betwixt a paraphrase
and imitation. It was not possible for us,
or any men, to have made it pleasant any other
way. If rendering the exact sense of those authors,
almost line for line, had been our business,
Barten Holyday had done it already to our hands:
and, by the help of his learned notes and illustrations,
not only Juvenal and Persius, but, what yet is
more obscure, his own verses, might be understood.</p>

<p>But he wrote for fame, and wrote to scholars:
we write only for the pleasure and entertainment of
those gentlemen and ladies, who, though they are
not scholars, are not ignorant: persons of understanding
and good sense, who, not having been
conversant in the original, or at least not having
made Latin verse so much their business as to be
critics in it, would be glad to find, if the wit of our
two great authors be answerable to their fame and
reputation in the world. We have, therefore, endeavoured
to give the public all the satisfaction we
are able in this kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>And if we are not altogether so faithful to our
author, as our predecessors Holyday and Stapylton,
yet we may challenge to ourselves this praise, that
we shall be far more pleasing to our readers. We
have followed our authors at greater distance, though
not step by step, as they have done: for oftentimes
they have gone so close, that they have trod on the
heels of Juvenal and Persius, and hurt them by
their too near approach. A noble author would not
be pursued too close by a translator. We lose his
spirit, when we think to take his body. The grosser
part remains with us, but the soul is flown away
in some noble expression, or some delicate turn of
words, or thought. Thus Holyday, who made this
way his choice, seized the meaning of Juvenal; but
the poetry has always escaped him.</p>

<p>They who will not grant me, that pleasure is one
of the ends of poetry, but that it is only a means
of compassing the only end, which is instruction,
must yet allow, that, without the means of pleasure,
the instruction is but a bare and dry philosophy:
a crude preparation of morals, which we may
have from Aristotle and Epictetus, with more profit
than from any poet. Neither Holyday nor Stapylton
have imitated Juvenal in the poetical part
of him&mdash;his diction and his elocution. Nor had
they been poets, as neither of them were, yet, in
the way they took, it was impossible for them to
have succeeded in the poetic part.</p>

<p>The English verse, which we call heroic, consists
of no more than ten syllables; the Latin hexameter
sometimes rises to seventeen; as, for example, this
verse in Virgil:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Pulverulenta putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>Here is the difference of no less than seven syllables
in a line, betwixt the English and the Latin.
Now the medium of these is about fourteen syllables;
because the dactyle is a more frequent
foot in hexameters than the spondee. But Holyday,
without considering that he wrote with
the disadvantage of four syllables less in every
verse, endeavours to make one of his lines to comprehend
the sense of one of Juvenal's. According
to the falsity of the proposition was the success.
He was forced to crowd his verse with ill-sounding
monosyllables, of which our barbarous language affords
him a wild plenty; and by that means he arrived
at his pedantic end, which was to make a literal
translation. His verses have nothing of verse
in them, but only the worst part of it&mdash;the rhyme;
and that, into the bargain, is far from good. But,
which is more intolerable, by cramming his ill-chosen,
and worse-sounding monosyllables so close together,
the very sense which he endeavours to explain,
is become more obscure than that of his author;
so that Holyday himself cannot be understood,
without as large a commentary as that which
he makes on his two authors. For my own part, I
can make a shift to find the meaning of Juvenal
without his notes: but his translation is more difficult
than his author. And I find beauties in the Latin
to recompense my pains; but, in Holyday and
Stapylton, my ears, in the first place, are mortally
offended; and then their sense is so perplexed, that
I return to the original, as the more pleasing task,
as well as the more easy.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>This must be said for our translation, that, if we
give not the whole sense of Juvenal, yet we give
the most considerable part of it: we give it, in general,
so clearly, that few notes are sufficient to
make us intelligible. We make our author at least
appear in a poetic dress. We have actually made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
him more sounding, and more elegant, than he was
before in English; and have endeavoured to make
him speak that kind of English, which he would
have spoken had he lived in England, and had
written to this age. If sometimes any of us (and
it is but seldom) make him express the customs
and manners of our native country rather than of
Rome, it is, either when there was some kind of
analogy betwixt their customs and ours, or when,
to make him more easy to vulgar understandings,
we give him those manners which are familiar to
us. But I defend not this innovation, it is enough
if I can excuse it. For, to speak sincerely, the manners
of nations and ages are not to be confounded;
we should either make them English, or leave them
Roman. If this can neither be defended nor excused,
let it be pardoned at least, because it is acknowledged;
and so much the more easily, as being
a fault which is never committed without some
pleasure to the reader.</p>

<p>Thus, my lord, having troubled you with a tedious
visit, the best manners will be shewn in the
least ceremony. I will slip away while your back
is turned, and while you are otherwise employed;
with great confusion for having entertained you so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>long with this discourse, and for having no other
recompence to make you, than the worthy labours
of my fellow-undertakers in this work, and the
thankful acknowledgments, prayers, and perpetual
good wishes, of,</p>

Howard, on his incomparable and incomprehensible Poem,
called the British Princes;" another to the same on his plays; a

however, of this exaggerated praise falls on the encomiast, not

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Dryden's recollection seems here deficient. There is, no doubt,
a close imitation of the Iliad throughout the Jerusalem; but the
death of the Swedish Prince was so far from being the motive of
Rinaldo's return to the wars, that Rinaldo seems never to have

<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> This passage is certainly inaccurate in one particular, and
probably in the rest. Sir Philip Sydney was killed at the battle of
Zutphen, 16th October, 1586, and the "Faery Queen" was then
only commenced. For, in a dialogue written by Bryskett, as Mr
Malone conjectures, betwixt 1584 and 1586, Spenser is introduced
describing himself as having undertaken a work in heroical
verse, under the title of a "Faerie Queene;" and it is clear that
he continued to labour in that task till 1594, when we learn, from
his 80th sonnet, that he had just composed six books:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">After so long a race as I have run<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through Faery Land, which those six books compile,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Out of my prison will I break anew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stoutly will that second work assoyle,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With strong endevour, and attention due.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
It was not, therefore, the death of Sir Philip Sydney which deprived
him of spirit to continue his captivating poem, since the
greater part was written after that event; but the poet's domestic
misfortunes, occasioned by Tyrone's rebellion, which seem at once to
have ruined his fortune, and broken his heart. See <span class="smcap">Todd's</span> <i>Life</i>
<i>of Spenser</i>, and <span class="smcap">Malone's</span> Note on this passage.
</p>
<p>
It seems unlikely, that Sydney was Spenser's Prince Arthur.
Upton more justly considers Leicester, a worthless character, but
the favourite of Gloriana, (Queen Elizabeth,) and who aspired to
share her bed and throne, as depicted under that character. See
<span class="smcap">Todd's</span> <i>Spenser</i>, Vol. I. Life, p. clxviii.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> This was a charge brought against Spenser so early as the days
of Ben Jonson; who says, in his Discoveries, "Spenser, in affecting
the ancients, writ no language; yet I would have him read for his
matter, but as Virgil read Ennius." This has been generally supposed
to apply only to Spenser's "Pastorals;" but as in these he
imitates rather a coarse and provincial than an obsolete dialect,
the limitation of Jonson's censure is probably imaginary. It is
probable, that, as the style of poetry in the latter part of Queen
Elizabeth's reign, and in that of her successor, had become laboured
and ornate, Spenser's imitations of the old metrical romances
had to his contemporaries an antique air of rude and naked simplicity,
although his "Faery Queen" seems more intelligible to us
than the compositions of Jonson himself. Dryden, whose charge
was afterwards echoed by Pope, probably adopted it without very
accurate investigation. Our idea of what is ancient does not necessarily
imply obscurity; on the contrary, I am afraid that to
modern ears the style of Addison sounds more antiquated than
that of Dr Johnson; so that simplicity may produce the same effect
as unintelligibility.</p></div>

to favour the public with "some reflections on that Paradise
Lost of Milton, which some are pleased to call a poem, and

of his presumption, by attempting to fulfil.</p></div>

"Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, a certain
man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold
of Uphaz: His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the
appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms
and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his
words like the voice of a multitude. And I Daniel alone saw the
vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a
great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.
Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained
no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me
into corruption, and I retained no strength. Yet heard I the voice
of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was
I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face towards the ground.
</p>
<p>
"And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my
knees and upon the palms of my hands: And he said unto me, O
Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak
unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And,
when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling. Then
said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou
didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before
thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.
But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and
twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to
help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia. Now I
am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in
the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days. And when
he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the
ground, and I became dumb. And, behold, one like the similitude
of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth,
and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord,
by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained
no strength. For how can the servant of this my lord talk with
this my lord? for, as for me, straightway there remained no
strength in me, neither is there breath left in me. Then there
came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and
he strengthened me. And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not;
peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And, when he had
spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak;
for thou hast strengthened me. Then said he, knowest thou wherefore
I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the
prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of
Grecia shall come. But I will shew thee that which is noted in
the scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in
these things, but Michael your prince."&mdash;Dan. x. 5-21.

"La premi&eacute;re diff&eacute;rence, qui est i&ccedil;i &agrave; remarquer et dont on ne
peut disconvenir, c'est que les Satyres ou po&euml;mes satyriques des
Grecs, etoient des pi&eacute;ces dramatiques, ou de th&eacute;atre; ce qu'on ne
peut point dire des Satires Romaines, prises dans tous ces trois
genres, dont je viens de parler, et auxquelles on a appliqu&eacute; ce
mot. Il y auroit peut-&ecirc;tre plus de sujet d'en douter, &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de
ces premi&eacute;res Satires des anciens Romains, dont il a &eacute;t&eacute; fait mention,
et dont il ne nous est rien rest&eacute;, si les passages de deux auteurs
Latins et de T. Live entre autres, qui en parlent, ne marquoient
en termes expr&egrave;s, qu'elles avoient pr&eacute;ced&eacute; parmi eux les
pi&eacute;ces dramatiques, et etoient en effet d'une autre esp&eacute;ce. D'ou
vient aussi, que les Latins, quand ils font mention de la po&euml;sie
Grecque, et d'ailleurs se contentent de donner aux premi&eacute;res ce
nom de <i>po&euml;me</i>, comme Ciceron le donne aux Satires de Varron,
et d'autres un nom pareil &agrave; celles de Lucilius ou d'Horace.
</p>
<p>
"La seconde diff&eacute;rence entre les po&euml;mes satyriques des Grecs,
et les Satires des Latins, vient de ce qu'il y a m&ecirc;me quelque diversit&eacute;
dans le nom, laquelle ne paroit pas autrement dans les langues
vulgaires. C'est qu'en effet les Grecs donnoient aux leurs le nom
de Satyrus ou Satiri, de Satyriques, de pi&eacute;ces Satyriques, par rapport,
s'entend, aux Satyres, ces hostes de bois, et ces compagnons
de Baccus, qui y jouoient leur r&ocirc;le: et d'ou vient aussi, qu'Horace,
comme nous avons d&eacute;ja v&ucirc;, les appelle <i>agrestes Satyros</i>, et
ceux, qui en &eacute;toient les auteurs, du nom de <i>Satyrorum Scriptor.</i>
Au lieu que les Romains ont dit <i>Satira</i> ou <i>Satura</i> de ces po&euml;mes,
auxquels ils en ont appliqu&eacute; et restraint le nom; que leurs auteurs
et leurs grammairiens donnent une autre origine, et une autre
signification de ce mot, comme celle d'un m&eacute;lange de plusieurs
fruits de la terre, ou bien de plusieurs mets dans un plat; del&agrave;
celle d'un m&eacute;lange de plusieurs loix comprises dans une, ou enfin
la signification d'un po&euml;me m&ecirc;l&eacute; de plusieurs choses.
</p>
<p>
"La troisi&eacute;me diff&eacute;rence entre ces m&ecirc;mes Satires et les pi&eacute;ces
satyriques des Grecs est, qu'en effet l'introduction des Sil&eacute;nes et
des Satyres, qui composoient les choeurs de ces derni&eacute;res, etoient
tellement de leur essence, que sans eux elles ne pouvoient plus
porter le nom de <i>Satyres</i>. Tellement qu'Horace, parlant entre
autres de la nature de ces Satyres ou po&euml;mes satyriques des Grecs,
s'arr&ecirc;te a montrer, en quelle mani&eacute;re on y doit faire parler Sil&eacute;ne,
ou les Satyres; ce qu'on leur doit faire &eacute;viter ou observer. Ce
qu'l n'auroit pas fait avec tant de soin, s'il avoit cru, que la pr&eacute;sence
des Satyres ne fut pas de la nature et de l'essence, comme
je viens de dire, de ces sortes de pi&eacute;ces, qui en portoient le nom.
</p>
<p>
"C'est &agrave; quoi on peut ajouter l'action de ces m&ecirc;mes Satyres,
et qui etoient propres aux pi&eacute;ces, qui en portoient le nom. C'est
qu'en effet les danses etoient si fort de leur essence, que non seulement
Aristote, comme nous avons d&eacute;ja veu, joint ensemble la
<i>po&euml;sie satyrique et faite pour la danse</i>; mais qu'un autre auteur
Grec [<i>Lucianus</i> &pi;&epsilon;&rho;&iota; &#x1F40;&rho;&chi;&#x1F75;&sigma;&epsilon;&omega;&sigmaf;]
parle nomm&eacute;ment des trois diff&eacute;rentes
sortes de danses attach&eacute;s au th&eacute;atre, <i>la tragique, la comique, et</i>
<i>la satyrique</i>. D'o&ugrave; vient aussi, comme il le remarque ailleurs,
que les Satires en prirent le nom de <i>Sicynnistes</i>; c'est &agrave; dire d'une
sorte de danse, qui leur etoit particuli&eacute;re, comme on peut voir entre
autres de ce qu'en dit Sil&eacute;ne dans le Cyclope, &agrave; la veu&euml;
des Satyres; et ainsi d'ou on peut ass&eacute;s comprendre la force de
l'&eacute;pith&eacute;te de <i>saltantes Satyros</i>, que Virgile leur donne en quelque
endroit; ou de ce qu'Horace, dans sa premi&eacute;re Ode, parle des
danses des Nymphes et des Satyres, <i>Nympharumque leues cum Satyris</i>
<i>chori</i>. Tout cela, comme chacun voit, n'avoit aucun raport
avec les Satires Romaines, et il n'est pas n&eacute;cessaire, d'en dire davantage,
pour le faire entendre.</p>

<p>"La quatri&eacute;me diff&eacute;rence resulte des sujets ass&eacute;s divers des uns
et des autres. Les Satyres des Grecs, comme il a d&eacute;ja &eacute;t&eacute; remarqu&eacute;,
et qu'on peut juger par les titres, qui nous en restent,
prenoient d'ordinaire, non seulement des sujets connus, mais fabuleux;
ce qui fait dire l&agrave;-dessus &agrave; Horace, <i>ex noto carmen fictum</i>
<i>sequar</i>; des heros, par exemple, ou des demi-dieux des si&eacute;cles pass&eacute;s,
&agrave; quoi le m&ecirc;me po&euml;te venoit de faire allusion. Les Satires
Romaines, comme leurs auteurs en parlent eux-m&ecirc;mes, et qu'ils le
pratiquent, s'attachoient &aacute; reprendre les vices ou les erreurs de
leur si&eacute;cle et de leur patrie; &agrave; y jouer des particuliers de Rome,
un Mutius entre autres, et un Lupus, avec Lucilius; un Milonius
et un Nomentanus, avec Horace; un Crispinus et un Locustus,
avec Juvenal; c'est &agrave; dire des gens, qui nous seroient peu connus
aujourdhui, sans la mention, qu'ils ont trouv&eacute; &agrave; propos d'en faire
dans leurs satires.</p>

<p>"La cinqui&eacute;me diff&eacute;rence paroit encore dans la mani&eacute;re, de laquelle
les uns et les autres traitent leurs sujets, et dans le but
principal, qu'ils s'y proposent. Celui de la po&euml;sie satyrique des
Grecs, etoit de tourner en ridicule des actions s&eacute;rieuses, comme
l'enseigne le m&ecirc;me Horace, <i>vertere seria ludo</i>; de trav&ecirc;stir pour ce
sujet leurs dieux ou leurs h&eacute;ros, d'en changer le caract&eacute;re, selon
le besoin; de faire par exemple d'un Achille un homme mol, suivant
qu'un autre po&euml;te Latin y fait allusion, <i>Nec nocet autori, qui</i>
<i>mollem fecit Achillem</i>. C'&eacute;toit en un mot leur but principal, de
rire et de plaisanter; et d'ou vient non seulement le mot de <i>Risus</i>,
comme il a d&eacute;ja &eacute;t&eacute; remarqu&eacute;, qu'on a appliqu&eacute; &agrave; ces sortes
d'ouvrages, mais aussi ceux en Grec de <i>jeux</i>, ou m&ecirc;me de jou&euml;ts,
et de <i>joci</i> en Latin, comme fait encore Horace, o&ugrave; il parle de
l'auteur tragique, qui parmi les Grecs fut le premier, qui composa
de ces pi&eacute;ces satyriques, et suivant qu'il dit, <i>incolumi gravitate jocum</i>
<i>tentavit</i>. Nons pouvons m&ecirc;me comprendre de ce qu'il ajoute
dans la suite et des epith&eacute;tes, que d'autres leur donnent de ris obsc&eacute;nes,
que cette gravit&eacute;, avec laquelle on avoit d'abord temper&eacute;
ces sortes d'ouvrages, en fut bannie dans la suite; que les r&eacute;gles
de la pudeur n'y furent gu&eacute;res observ&eacute;es; et qu'on en fit des spectacles
ass&eacute;s conformes &agrave; l'humeur et &agrave; la conduite de tels acteurs
que des satires petulans ou <i>protervi</i>, comme Horace les appelle sur
ce m&ecirc;me sujet. Et c'est &agrave; quoi contribuerent d'ailleurs leurs
danses et leurs postures, dont il &agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; parl&eacute;, de m&ecirc;me que celles
des pantomimes parmi les Romains. Au lieu que les Satires Romaines,
temoin celles qui nous restent, et &aacute; qui d'ailleurs ce nom
est demeur&eacute; comme propre et attach&eacute;, avoient moins pour but de
plaisanter que d'exciter ou de l'indignation, ou de la haine, <i>facit</i>
<i>indignatio versum</i>, ou du m&eacute;pris; qu'elles s'attachent plus &agrave; reprendre
et &agrave; mordre, qu'&agrave; faire rire ou &agrave; fol&acirc;trer. D'ou vient
aussi le nom de <i>po&euml;me medisant</i>, que les grammairiens leur donnent,
ou celui de <i>vers mordans</i>, comme en parle Ovide dans un
passage, o&ugrave; je trouve qu'il se d&eacute;fend de n'avoir point &eacute;crit de Satyres.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Non ego mordaci distrinxi carmine quemquam,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Nec meus ullius crimina versus habet.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Je ne touche pas enfin la diff&eacute;rence, qu'on pourroit encore all&eacute;guer
de la composition diverse des unes et des autres; les Satires
Romaines, dont il est ici proprement question et qui ont &eacute;t&eacute;
conserv&eacute;es jusques &agrave; nous, ayant &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;crites en vers h&eacute;roiques, et
les po&euml;mes satyriques des Grecs en vers jambiques. Ce qui devroit
n&eacute;anmoins &ecirc;tre d'autant plus remarqu&eacute;, qu'Horace ne trouve
point d'autre diff&eacute;rence entre l'inventeur des Satires Romaines et
les auteurs de l'ancienne com&eacute;die, comme Cratinus et Eupolis, si
non que les Satires du premier &eacute;toient &eacute;crites dans un autre genre
de vers."&mdash;See Baron <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Spanheim's</span></em> Dissertation, <i>Sur les</i> Cesars

Book, introduces Lucilius as imitating the ancient Greek comedians:
</p>

</div></div>
<p>
Towards the end of the Tenth Satire, the poet resumes the subject,
and vindicates his character of Lucilius against those who
had accused him of too much severity towards the ancient satirist;
and again accuses him of carelessness, though he acknowledges his
superiority to the more ancient models:
</p>

prejudices. "He was an upright judge, if taken within himself;
and when he appeared, as he often did, and really was, partial, his
inclination or prejudice, insensibly to himself, drew his judgment
aside. His bias lay strangely for, and against, characters and denominations;
and sometimes, the very habits of persons. If one
party was a courtier, and well dressed, and the other a sort of
puritan, with a black cap and plain clothes, he insensibly thought
the justice of the cause with the latter. If the dissenting, or anti-court
party was at the back of a cause, he was very seldom impartial;
and the loyalists had always a great disadvantage before him.
And he ever sat hard upon his lordship, in his practice, in causes
of that nature, as may be observed in the cases of Cuts and Pickering,
just before, and of Soams and Bernardiston elsewhere, related.
It is said he was once caught. A courtier, who had a cause to be
tried before him, got one to go to him, as from the king, to speak
for favour to his adversary, and so carried his point; for the Chief
Justice could not think any person to be in the right, that came so
unduly recommended." <i>Life of Lord Keeper Guilford</i>, p. 61.</p></div>

Satire of the 1st Book. Wycherley, the friend for whom he
wishes a father of equal tenderness, after having been gayest of
the gay, applauded by theatres, and the object of a monarch's jealousy,
was finally thrown into jail for debt, and lay there seven
long years, his father refusing him any assistance. And, although
in 1697, he was probably at liberty, for King James had interposed
in his favour and paid a great part of his debts, he continued to
labour under pecuniary embarrassments untill his father's death

of the 16th century. Wood says, he was second to none for his
poetry and sublime fancy, and brings in witness his "smooth translation
of rough Persius," made before he was twenty years of
age. He wrote a play called "Technogamia, or the Marriage of
the Arts," which was acted at Christ Church College, before
James I., and, though extremely dull and pedantic, was ill received
by his Majesty. Holyday's version of Juvenal was not published
till after his death, when, in 1673, it was inscribed to the dean and
canons of Christ Church. As he had adopted the desperate resolution
of comprising every Latin line within an English one, the
modern reader has often reason to complain, with the embarrassed
gentleman in the "Critic," that the interpreter is the harder to be
understood of the two.</p></div>

Yorkshire, who followed the fortune of Charles I. in the civil war,
besides several plays and poems, published a version of Juvenal, under
the title of "The manners of Men described in sixteen Satires
by Juvenal." There are two editions, the first published in 1647,
and the last and most perfect in 1660. Sir Robert Stapylton died
in 1669. His verse is as harsh and uncouth as that of Holyday, who
indeed charged him with plagiary; though one would have thought
the nature of the commodity would have set theft at defiance.</p></div>

lawyer, and his having been the agent of the crown, during the cruel
persecution of the fanatical Cameronians, renders him still execrated

<h3>THE<br />

FIRST SATIRE<br />

OF<br />

JUVENAL.</h3>


<p class="center">THE ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>The Poet gives us first a kind of humorous reason for his writing: that</i>
<i>being provoked by hearing so many ill poets rehearse their works, he</i>
<i>does himself justice on them, by giving them as bad as they bring.</i>
<i>But since no man will rank himself with ill writers, it is easy to</i>
<i>conclude, that if such wretches could draw an audience, he thought</i>
<i>it no hard matter to excel them, and gain a greater esteem with the</i>
<i>public. Next, he informs us more openly, why he rather addicts</i>
<i>himself to satire than any other kind of poetry. And here he discovers,</i>
<i>that it is not so much his indignation to ill poets as to ill</i>
<i>men, which has prompted him to write. He, therefore, gives us a</i>
<i>summary and general view of the vices and follies reigning in his</i>
<i>time. So that this first satire is the natural ground-work of all the</i>
<i>rest. Herein he confines himself to no one subject, but strikes indifferently</i>
<i>at all men in his way. In every following satire he has chosen</i>
<i>some particular moral which he would inculcate; and lashes</i>
<i>some particular vice or folly, (an art with which our lampooners</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span><i>are not much acquainted). But our poet being desirous to reform</i>
<i>his own age, and not daring to attempt it by an overt-act of naming</i>
<i>living persons, inveighs only against those who were infamous in the</i>
<i>times immediately preceding his, whereby he not only gives a fair</i>
<i>warning to great men, that their memory lies at the mercy of future</i>
<i>poets and historians, but also, with a finer stroke of his pen, brands</i>
<i>even the living, and personates them under dead men's names.</i></p>

<p><i>I have avoided, as much as I could possibly, the borrowed learning of</i>
<i>marginal notes and illustrations, and for that reason have translated</i>
<i>this satire somewhat largely; and freely own, (if it be a fault,)</i>
<i>that I have likewise omitted most of the proper names, because I</i>
<i>thought they would not much edify the reader. To conclude, if in</i>
<i>two or three places I have deserted all the commentators, it is because</i>
<i>I thought they first deserted my author, or at least have left</i>
<i>him in so much obscurity, that too much room is left for guessing.</i></p></div>

<h3>THE<br />

THIRD SATIRE<br />

OF<br />

JUVENAL.</h3>


<p class="center">THE ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>The story of this satire speaks itself. Umbritius, the supposed</i>
<i>friend of Juvenal, and himself a poet, is leaving Rome, and retiring</i>
<i>to Cum&aelig;. Our author accompanies him out of town.</i>
<i>Before they take leave of each other, Umbritius tells his friend</i>
<i>the reasons which oblige him to lead a private life, in an obscure</i>
<i>place. He complains, that an honest man cannot get his bread at</i>
<i>Rome; that none but flatterers make their fortunes there; that</i>
<i>Grecians, and other foreigners, raise themselves by those sordid</i>
<i>arts which he describes, and against which he bitterly inveighs.</i>
<i>He reckons up the several inconveniences which arise from a city</i>
<i>life, and the many dangers which attend it; upbraids the noblemen</i>
<i>with covetousness, for not rewarding good poets; and arraigns</i>
<i>the government for starving them. The great art of this</i>
<i>satire is particularly shown in common-places; and drawing in</i>
<i>as many vices, as could naturally fall into the compass of it.</i></p></div>

<span class="i0">Childless Arturius, vastly rich before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, by his losses, multiplies his store;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">But, could you be content to bid adieu<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the dear playhouse, and the players too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet country-seats are purchased every where,  <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">With lands and gardens, at less price than here <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">You hire a darksome dog-hole by the year.       <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">A small convenience decently prepared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shallow well, that rises in your yard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That spreads his easy crystal streams around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waters all the pretty spot of ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, love the fork, thy garden cultivate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give thy frugal friends a Pythagorean treat;<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis somewhat to be lord of some small ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which a lizard may, at least, turn round.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis frequent here, for want of sleep, to die,   <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Which fumes of undigested feasts deny,             <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>

<span class="i0">What house secure from noise the poor can keep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When even the rich can scarce afford to sleep?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So dear it costs to purchase rest in Rome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hence the sources of diseases come.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The drover, who his fellow-drover meets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In narrow passages of winding streets;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waggoners, that curse their standing teams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would wake even drowsy Drusus from his dreams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet the wealthy will not brook delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sweep above our heads, and make their way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In lofty litters borne, and read and write,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sleep at ease, the shutters make it night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still he reaches first the public place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The press before him stops the client's pace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crowd that follows crush his panting sides,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor limbs, nor bones, nor carcase, would remain,<br /></span>

<h3>THE<br />

SIXTH SATIRE<br />

OF<br />

JUVENAL.</h3>


<p class="center">THE ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>This Satire, of almost double length to any of the rest, is a bitter invective</i>
<i>against the fair sex. It is, indeed, a common-place, from whence</i>
<i>all the moderns have notoriously stolen their sharpest railleries. In</i>
<i>his other satires, the poet has only glanced on some particular women,</i>
<i>and generally scourged the men; but this he reserved wholly for the</i>
<i>ladies. How they had offended him, I know not; but, upon the</i>
<i>whole matter, he is not to be excused for imputing to all, the vices of</i>
<i>some few amongst them. Neither was it generously done of him, to</i>
<i>attack the weakest, as well as the fairest, part of the creation; neither</i>
<i>do I know what moral he could reasonably draw from it. It</i>
<i>could not be to avoid the whole sex, if all had been true which he</i>
<i>alleges against them; for that had been to put an end to human</i>
<i>kind. And to bid us beware of their artifices, is a kind of silent acknowledgment,</i>
<i>that they have more wit than men; which turns the</i>
<i>satire upon us, and particularly upon the poet, who thereby makes a</i>
<i>compliment, where he meant a libel. If he intended only to exercise</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a><br /><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span><i>his wit, he has forfeited his judgment, by making the one half of his</i>
<i>readers his mortal enemies; and amongst the men, all the happy lovers,</i>
<i>by their own experience, will disprove his accusations. The</i>
<i>whole world must allow this to be the wittiest of his satires; and</i>
<i>truly he had need of all his parts, to maintain, with so much violence,</i>
<i>so unjust a charge. I am satisfied he will bring but few over</i>
<i>to his opinion; and on that consideration chiefly I ventured to trans</i>
<i>late him. Though there wanted not another reason, which was, that</i>
<i>no one else would undertake it; at least, Sir C. S., who could have</i>
<i>done more right to the author, after a long delay, at length absolutely</i>
<i>refused so ungrateful an employment; and every one will grant,</i>
<i>that the work must have been imperfect and lame, if it had appeared</i>
<i>without one of the principal members belonging to it. Let the poet,</i>
<i>therefore, bear the blame of his own invention; and let me satisfy</i>
<i>the world, that I am not of his opinion. Whatever his Roman ladies</i>
<i>were, the English are free from all his imputations. They will</i>
<i>read with wonder and abhorrence the vices of an age, which was the</i>
<i>most infamous of any on record. They will bless themselves when</i>
<i>they behold those examples, related of Domitian's time; they will</i>
<i>give back to antiquity those monsters it produced, and believe, with</i>
<i>reason, that the species of those women is extinguished, or, at least,</i>
<i>that they were never here propagated. I may safely, therefore, proceed</i>
<i>to the argument of a satire, which is no way relating to them;</i>
<i>and first observe, that my author makes their lust the most heroic of</i>
<i>their vices; the rest are in a manner but digression. He skims them</i>
<i>over, but he dwells on this; when he seems to have taken his last leave</i>
<i>of it, on the sudden he returns to it: It is one branch of it in Hippia,</i>
<i>another in Messalina, but lust is the main body of the tree. He</i>
<i>begins with this text in the first line, and takes it up, with intermissions,</i>
<i>to the end of the chapter. Every vice is a loader, but that is</i>
<i>a ten. The fillers, or intermediate parts, are&mdash;their revenge; their</i>
<i>contrivances of secret crimes; their arts to hide them; their wit to</i>
<i>excuse them; and their impudence to own them, when they can no</i>
<i>longer be kept secret. Then the persons to whom they are most addicted,</i>
<i>and on whom they commonly bestow the last favours, as stage-players,</i>
<i>fiddlers, singing-boys, and fencers. Those who pass for</i>
<i>chaste amongst them, are not really so; but only, for their vast</i>
<i>doweries, are rather suffered, than loved, by their own husbands.</i>
<i>That they are imperious, domineering, scolding wives; set up for learning,</i>
<i>and criticism in poetry; but are false judges: Love to speak</i>
<i>Greek, (which was then the fashionable tongue, as French is now</i>
<i>with us). That they plead causes at the bar, and play prizes at the</i>
<i>bear-garden: That they are gossips and newsmongers; wrangle with</i>
<i>their neighbours abroad, and beat their servants at home: That they</i>
<i>lie-in for new faces once a month; are sluttish with their husbands</i>
<i>in private, and paint and dress in public for their lovers: That they</i>
<i>deal with Jews, diviners, and fortune-tellers; learn the arts of miscarrying</i>
<i>and barrenness; buy children, and produce them for their</i>
<i>own; murder their husbands' sons, if they stand in their way to his</i>
<i>estate, and make their adulterers his heirs. From hence the poet</i>
<i>proceeds to show the occasions of all these vices, their original, and</i>
<i>how they were introduced in Rome by peace, wealth, and luxury. In</i>
<i>conclusion, if we will take the word of our malicious author, bad</i>
<i>women are the general standing rule; and the good, but some few</i>
<i>exceptions to it.</i></p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In Saturn's reign, at Nature's early birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was that thing called Chastity on earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When in a narrow cave, their common shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sheep, the shepherds, and their gods were laid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When reeds, and leaves, and hides of beasts, were spread, <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">By mountain-housewives, for their homely bed,             <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">And mossy pillows raised, for the rude husband's head.    <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Unlike the niceness of our modern dames,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Affected nymphs, with new-affected names,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Cynthias, and the Lesbias of our years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who for a sparrow's death dissolve in tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those first unpolished matrons, big and bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave suck to infants of gigantic mould;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rough as their savage lords, who ranged the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, fat with acorns, belched their windy food.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when the world was buxom, fresh, and young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sons were undebauched, and therefore strong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whether born in kindly beds of earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or struggling from the teeming oaks to birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or from what other atoms they begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sires they had, or, if a sire, the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some thin remains of chastity appeared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even under Jove,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> but Jove without a beard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the servile Greeks had learnt to swear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By heads of kings; while yet the bounteous year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her common fruits in open plains exposed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere thieves were feared, or gardens were inclosed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length uneasy Justice upwards flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And both the sisters to the stars withdrew;<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From that old &aelig;ra whoring did begin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So venerably ancient is the sin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adulterers next invade the nuptial state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And marriage-beds creaked with a foreign weight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All other ills did iron times adorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whores and silver in one age were born.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet thou, they say, for marriage dost provide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is this an age to buckle with a bride?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They say thy hair the curling art is taught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wedding-ring perhaps already bought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sober man like thee to change his life!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What fury would possess thee with a wife?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art thou of every other death bereft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No knife, no ratsbane, no kind halter left?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For every noose compared to her's is cheap.)<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Is there no city-bridge from whence to leap?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would'st thou become her drudge, who dost enjoy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A better sort of bedfellow, thy boy?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He keeps thee not awake with nightly brawls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor, with a begged reward, thy pleasure palls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor, with insatiate heavings, calls for more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all thy spirits were drained out before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still Ursidius courts the marriage-bait,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Longs for a son to settle his estate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And takes no gifts, though every gaping heir<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would gladly grease the rich old bachelor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What revolution can appear so strange,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As such a lecher such a life to change?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rank, notorious whoremaster, to choose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thrust his neck into the marriage-noose?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He who so often, in a dreadful fright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had, in a coffer, 'scaped the jealous cuckold's sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he, to wedlock dotingly betrayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should hope, in this lewd town, to find a maid!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man's grown mad! to ease his frantic pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Run for the surgeon, breathe the middle vein;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But let a heifer, with gilt horns, be led<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Juno, regent of the marriage-bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let him every deity adore,              <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">If his new bride prove not an arrant whore, <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">In head, and tail, and every other pore.    <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">On Ceres' feast,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> restrained from their delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Few matrons there, but curse the tedious night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Few whom their fathers dare salute, such lust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their kisses have, and come with such a gust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ivy now adorn thy doors, and wed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such is thy bride, and such thy genial bed.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Think'st thou one man is for one woman meant?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sooner with one eye would be content.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And yet, 'tis noised, a maid did once appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some small village, though fame says not where.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis possible; but sure no man she found;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas desart all about her father's ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet some lustful God might there make bold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are Jove and Mars grown impotent and old?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a fair nymph has in a cave been spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And much good love without a feather-bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whither would'st thou, to chuse a wife, resort,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The park, the mall, the playhouse, or the court?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which way soever thy adventures fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure alike of chastity in all.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One sees a dancing-master capering high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raves, and pisses, with pure extacy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another does with all his motions move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gapes, and grins, as in the feat of love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A third is charmed with the new opera notes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admires the song, but on the singer dotes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The country lady in the box appears,        <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Softly she warbles over all she hears,      <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">And sucks in passion both at eyes and ears. <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i2">The rest (when now the long vacation's come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noisy hall and theatres grown dumb)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their memories to refresh, and cheer their hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In borrowed breeches, act the players' parts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poor, that scarce have wherewithal to eat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will pinch, to make the singing-boy a treat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rich, to buy him, will refuse no price,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stretch his quail-pipe, till they crack his voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tragedians, acting love, for lust are sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though but the parrots of a poet's thought.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The pleading lawyer, though for counsel used,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In chamber-practice often is refused.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still thou wilt have a wife, and father heirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The product of concurring theatres.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps a fencer did thy brows adorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a young swordsman to thy lands is born.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus Hippia loathed her old patrician lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left him for a brother of the sword.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wondering Pharos<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> with her love she fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To show one monster more than Afric bred;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgetting house and husband left behind,     <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Even children too, she sails before the wind; <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">False to them all, but constant to her kind.  <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">But, stranger yet, and harder to conceive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She could the playhouse and the players leave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Born of rich parentage, and nicely bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She lodged on down, and in a damask bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet daring now the dangers of the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a hard mattress is content to sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere this, 'tis true, she did her fame expose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that great ladies with great ease can lose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tender nymph could the rude ocean bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So much her lust was stronger than her fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But had some honest cause her passage prest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smallest hardship had disturbed her breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each inconvenience makes their virtue cold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But womankind in ills is ever bold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were she to follow her own lord to sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What doubts and scruples would she raise to stay?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her stomach sick, and her head giddy grows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tar and pitch are nauseous to her nose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in love's voyage nothing can offend,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Women are never sea-sick with a friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst the crew she walks upon the board,     <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">She eats, she drinks, she handles every cord; <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">And if she spews, 'tis thinking of her lord.  <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Now ask, for whom her friends and fame she lost?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What youth, what beauty, could the adulterer boast?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was the face, for which she could sustain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be called mistress to so base a man?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gallant of his days had known the best;             <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Deep scars were seen indented on his breast,            <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">And all his battered limbs required their needful rest; <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">A promontory wen, with grisly grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood high upon the handle of his face:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His blear-eyes ran in gutters to his chin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His beard was stubble, and his cheeks were thin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But 'twas his fencing did her fancy move;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis arms, and blood, and cruelty, they love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But should he quit his trade, and sheath his sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her lover would begin to be her lord.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This was a private crime; but you shall hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What fruits the sacred brows of monarchs bear:<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good old sluggard but began to snore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, from his side, up rose the imperial whore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, who preferred the pleasures of the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pomps, that are but impotent delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strode from the palace, with an eager pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cope with a more masculine embrace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Muffled she marched, like Juno in a cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all her train but one poor wench allowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One whom in secret-service she could trust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rival and companion of her lust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the known brothel-house she takes her way, <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">And for a nasty room gives double pay;        <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">That room in which the rankest harlot lay.    <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Prepared for fight, expectingly she lies,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With heaving breasts, and with desiring eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still as one drops, another takes his place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, baffled, still succeeds to like disgrace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length, when friendly darkness is expired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every strumpet from her cell retired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She lags behind and, lingering at the gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a repining sigh submits to fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All filth without, and all a fire within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tired with the toil, unsated with the sin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old C&aelig;sar's bed the modest matron seeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The steam of lamps still hanging on her cheeks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ropy smut; thus foul, and thus bedight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She brings him back the product of the night.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now, should I sing what poisons they provide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all their trumpery of charms beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all their arts of death,&mdash;it would be known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lust is the smallest sin the sex can own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">C&aelig;sinia still, they say, is guiltless found       <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Of every vice, by her own lord renowned;          <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">And well she may, she brought ten thousand pound. <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">She brought him wherewithal to be called chaste;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tongue is tied in golden fetters fast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sighs, adores, and courts her every hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who would not do as much for such a dower?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She writes love-letters to the youth in grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, tips the wink before the cuckold's face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And might do more, her portion makes it good;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Let her but have three wrinkles in her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let her eyes lessen, and her skin unbrace,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Soon you will hear the saucy steward say,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pack up with all your trinkets, and away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You grow offensive both at bed and board;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your betters must be had to please my lord.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Meantime she's absolute upon the throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, knowing time is precious, loses none.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She must have flocks of sheep, with wool more fine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than silk, and vineyards of the noblest wine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whole droves of pages for her train she craves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweeps the prisons for attending slaves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In short, whatever in her eyes can come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or others have abroad, she wants at home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When winter shuts the seas, and fleecy snows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make houses white, she to the merchant goes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich crystals of the rock she takes up there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge agate vases, and old china ware;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Berenice's ring<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> her finger proves,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Chaste as the Sabines, whose prevailing charms,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In ancient veins, ere heraldry began;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A black swan is not half so rare a bird.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In Greece, their whole accomplishments they seek:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their fashion, breeding, language, must be Greek;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, raw in all that does to Rome belong,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
<span class="i0">They scorn to cultivate their mother-tongue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Greek they flatter, all their fears they speak;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell all their secrets; nay, they scold in Greek:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even in the feat of love, they use that tongue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such affectations may become the young;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou, old hag, of three score years and three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is showing of thy parts in Greek for thee?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&Zeta;&omega;&#x1F74; &kappa;&alpha;&#x1F76; &psi;&upsilon;&chi;&#x1F74;! All those tender words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The momentary trembling bliss affords;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kind soft murmurs of the private sheets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are bawdy, while thou speak'st in public streets.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those words have fingers; and their force is such,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They raise the dead, and mount him with a touch.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all provocatives from thee are vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No blandishment the slackened nerve can strain.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If then thy lawful spouse thou canst not love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What reason should thy mind to marriage move?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why all the charges of the nuptial feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wine and deserts, and sweet-meats to digest?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The endowing gold that buys the dear delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Given for thy first and only happy night?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou art thus uxoriously inclined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bear thy bondage with a willing mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepare thy neck, and put it in the yoke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for no mercy from thy woman look.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For though, perhaps, she loves with equal fires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To absolute dominion she aspires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joys in the spoils, and triumphs o'er thy purse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The better husband makes the wife the worse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing is thine to give, or sell, or buy, <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">All offices of ancient friendship die,     <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor hast thou leave to make a legacy.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>  <span class="linenum">}<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></span>
<span class="i0">By thy imperious wife thou art bereft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A privilege, to pimps and panders left;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy testament's her will; where she prefers <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Her ruffians, drudges, and adulterers,      <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Adopting all thy rivals for thy heirs.      <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i2">Go drag that slave to death!&mdash;Your reason? why<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should the poor innocent be doomed to die?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What proofs? For, when man's life is in debate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The judge can ne'er too long deliberate.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Call'st thou that slave a man? the wife replies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proved, or unproved, the crime, the villain dies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have the sovereign power to save, or kill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give no other reason but my will.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus the she-tyrant reigns, till, pleased with change,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her wild affections to new empires range;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another subject-husband she desires;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divorced from him, she to the first retires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the last wedding-feast is scarcely o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And garlands hang yet green upon the door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So still the reckoning rises; and appears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In total sum, eight husbands in five years.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The title for a tomb-stone might be fit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that it would too commonly be writ.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her mother living, hope no quiet day;      <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">She sharpens her, instructs her how to flay  <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Her husband bare, and then divides the prey. <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">She takes love-letters, with a crafty smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in her daughter's answer, mends the style.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain the husband sets his watchful spies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She cheats their cunning, or she bribes their eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The doctor's called; the daughter, taught the trick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pretends to faint, and in full health is sick.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The panting stallion, at the closet-door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hears the consult, and wishes it were o'er.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Canst thou, in reason, hope, a bawd so known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should teach her other manners than her own?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her interest is in all the advice she gives;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis on the daughter's rents the mother lives.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No cause is tried at the litigious bar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But women plaintiffs or defendants are;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They form the process, all the briefs they write, <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">The topics furnish, and the pleas indict,         <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">And teach the toothless lawyer how to bite.       <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i2">They turn viragos too; the wrestler's toil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They try, and smear the naked limbs with oil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the post their wicker shields they crush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flourish the sword, and at the flastron push.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of every exercise the mannish crew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fulfils the parts, and oft excels us too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepared not only in feigned fights to engage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But rout the gladiators on the stage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What sense of shame in such a breast can lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inured to arms, and her own sex to fly?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet to be wholly man she would disclaim;  <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">To quit her tenfold pleasure at the game, <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">For frothy praises and an empty name.     <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Oh what a decent sight 'tis to behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All thy wife's magazine by auction sold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The belt, the crested plume, the several suits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of armour, and the Spanish leather boots!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet these are they, that cannot bear the heat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of figured silks, and under sarcenet sweat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold the strutting Amazonian whore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stands in guard with her right foot before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her coats tucked up, and all her motions just,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stamps, and then cries,&mdash;Hah! at every thrust;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But laugh to see her, tired with many a bout,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Call for the pot, and like a man piss out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ghosts of ancient Romans, should they rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would grin to see their daughters play a prize.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Besides, what endless brawls by wives are bred?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The curtain-lecture makes a mournful bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, when she has thee sure within the sheets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her cry begins, and the whole day repeats.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conscious of crimes herself, she teazes first;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy servants are accused; thy whore is curst;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She acts the jealous, and at will she cries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For womens' tears are but the sweat of eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor cuckold fool! thou think'st that love sincere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sucks between her lips the falling tear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But search her cabinet, and thou shalt find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each tiller there with love-epistles lined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suppose her taken in a close embrace,           <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">This you would think so manifest a case,        <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">No rhetoric could defend, no impudence outface; <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">And yet even then she cries,&mdash;The marriage-vow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mental reservation must allow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there's a silent bargain still implied,   <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">The parties should be pleased on either side, <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">And both may for their private needs provide. <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Though men yourselves, and women us you call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet <i>homo</i> is a common name for all.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's nothing bolder than a woman caught;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guilt gives them courage to maintain their fault.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You ask, from whence proceed these monstrous crimes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once poor, and therefore chaste, in former times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our matrons were; no luxury found room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In low-roofed houses, and bare walls of loam;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their hands with labour hardened while 'twas light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And frugal sleep supplied the quiet night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While pinched with want, their hunger held them straight,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We suffer all the inveterate ills of peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wasteful riot; whose destructive charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revenge the vanquished world of our victorious arms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No crime, no lustful postures are unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since Poverty, our guardian god, is gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pride, laziness, and all luxurious arts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pour, like a deluge, in from foreign parts:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since gold obscene, and silver found the way,      <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Strange fashions, with strange bullion, to convey, <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">And our plain simple manners to betray.            <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i2">What care our drunken dames to whom they spread?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wine no distinction makes of tail or head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who lewdly dancing at a midnight ball,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For hot eringoes and fat oysters call:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full brimmers to their fuddled noses thrust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brimmers, the last provocatives of lust;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When vapours to their swimming brains advance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And double tapers on the table dance.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now think what bawdy dialogues they have,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What Tullia talks to her confiding slave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Modesty's old statue; when by night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They make a stand, and from their litters light;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And toss their heads like an enamoured mare;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nothing is feigned in this venereal strife;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So full, so fierce, so vigorous, and so strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That looking on would make old Nestor young.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impatient of delay, a general sound,               <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">An universal groan of lust goes round;             <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>

<span class="i0">Now is the time of action; now begin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They cry, and let the lusty lovers in.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whoresons are asleep; then bring the slaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watermen, a race of strong-backed knaves.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I wish, at least, our sacred rites were free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From those pollutions of obscenity:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A lewd audacious action enterprized;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the fair, with women mixed, he went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Armed with a huge two-handed instrument;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A grateful present to those holy choirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the mouse, guilty of his sex, retires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even male pictures modestly are veiled:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet no profaneness in that age prevailed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No scoffers at religious rites were found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though now at every altar they abound.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I hear your cautious counsel; you would say,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But, who shall keep those keepers? Women, nurst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In craft; begin with those, and bribe them first.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sex is turned all whore; they love the game,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They live beyond their stint, as if their store<br /></span>

<h3>THE<br />

TENTH SATIRE<br />

OF<br />

JUVENAL.</h3>


<p class="center">THE ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>The Poet's design, in this divine Satire, is, to represent the various</i>
<i>wishes and desires of mankind, and to set out the folly of them. He</i>
<i>runs through all the several heads, of riches, honours, eloquence,</i>
<i>fame for martial achievements, long life, and beauty; and gives instances</i>
<i>in each, how frequently they have proved the ruin of those</i>
<i>that owned them. He concludes, therefore, that, since we generally</i>
<i>choose so ill for ourselves, we should do better to leave it to the gods</i>
<i>to make the choice for us. All we can safely ask of heaven, lies</i>
<i>within a very small compass&mdash;it is but health of body and mind; and</i>
<i>if we have these, it is not much matter what we want besides; for</i>
<i>we have already enough to make us happy.</i></p></div>

<span class="i2">Whole houses, of their whole desires possest,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In wars and peace things hurtful we require,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A troop of cut-throat guards were sent to seize<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The mob, commissioned by the government,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The fearful passenger, who travels late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charged with the carriage of a paltry plate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shakes at the moonshine shadow of a rush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sees a red-coat rise from every bush;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beggar sings, even when he sees the place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beset with thieves, and never mends his pace.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of all the vows, the first and chief request<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of each, is&mdash;to be richer than the rest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet no doubts the poor man's draught controul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dreads no poison in his homely bowl;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then fear the deadly drug, when gems divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enchase the cup, and sparkle in the wine.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Will you not now the pair of sages praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who the same end pursued by several ways?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One pitied, one contemned, the woeful times;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One laughed at follies, one lamented crimes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughter is easy; but the wonder lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What stores of brine supplied the weeper's eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Democritus could feed his spleen, and shake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sides and shoulders, till he felt them ache;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though in his country town no lictors were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor rods, nor axe, nor tribune, did appear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor all the foppish gravity of show,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">What had he done, had he beheld on high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our pr&aelig;tor seated in mock majesty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His chariot rolling o'er the dusty place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, with dumb pride, and a set formal face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He moves, in the dull ceremonial track,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With Jove's embroidered coat upon his back!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A suit of hangings had not more opprest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His shoulders, than that long laborious vest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A heavy gewgaw, called a crown, that spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About his temples, drowned his narrow head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would have crushed it with the massy freight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that a sweating slave sustained the weight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A slave, in the same chariot seen to ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mortify the mighty madman's pride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Add now the imperial eagle, raised on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With golden beak, the mark of majesty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trumpets before, and on the left and right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cavalcade of nobles, all in white;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their own natures false and flattering tribes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But made his friends by places and by bribes.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In his own age, Democritus could find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sufficient cause to laugh at human kind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Learn from so great a wit; a land of bogs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ditches fenced, a heaven fat with fogs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May form a spirit fit to sway the state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make the neighbouring monarchs fear their fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He laughs at all the vulgar cares and fears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At their vain triumphs, and their vainer tears:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An equal temper in his mind he found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When fortune flattered him, and when she frowned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis plain, from hence, that what our vows request<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are hurtful things, or useless at the best.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some ask for envied power; which public hate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursues, and hurries headlong to their fate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down go the titles; and the statue crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is by base hands in the next river drowned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The guiltless horses, and the chariot wheel,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What is the charge, and who the evidence,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nothing of this; but our old C&aelig;sar sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A noisy letter to his parliament.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, sirs, if C&aelig;sar writ, I ask no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's guilty, and the question's out of door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How goes the mob? (for that's a mighty thing,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the king's trump, the mob are for the king:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They follow fortune, and the common cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is still against the rogue condemned to die.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But the same very mob, that rascal crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had cried Sejanus, with a shout as loud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had his designs (by fortune's favour blest)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Succeeded, and the prince's age opprest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But long, long since, the times have changed their face,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But we, who give our native rights away,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Are now reduced to beg an alms, and go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On holidays to see a puppet-show.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There was a damned design, cries one, no doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For warrants are already issued out:<br /></span>

affecting fame beyond measure, and doing the most extravagant

boats over the Hellespont, where it was three miles broad; and
ordered a whipping for the winds and seas, because they had once
crossed his designs; as we have a very solemn account of it in
Herodotus. But, after all these vain boasts, he was shamefully

<h3>THE<br />

SIXTEENTH SATIRE<br />

OF<br />

JUVENAL.</h3>


<p class="center">THE ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>The Poet in this satire proves, that the condition of a soldier is</i>
<i>much better than that of a countryman; first, because a countryman,</i>
<i>however affronted, provoked, and struck himself, dares not</i>
<i>strike a soldier, who is only to be judged by a court-martial;</i>
<i>and, by the law of Camillus, which obliges him not to quarrel</i>
<i>without the trenches, he is also assured to have a speedy hearing,</i>
<i>and quick dispatch; whereas, the townsman, or peasant, is delayed</i>
<i>in his suit by frivolous pretences, and not sure of justice when</i>
<i>he is heard in the court. The soldier is also privileged to make</i>
<i>a will, and to give away his estate, which he got in war, to whom</i>
<i>he pleases, without consideration of parentage, or relations, which</i>
<i>is denied to all other Romans. This satire was written by Juvenal,</i>
<i>when he was a commander in Egypt: it is certainly his,</i>
<i>though I think it not finished. And if it be well observed, you</i>
<i>will find he intended an invective against a standing army.</i></p></div>

<p class="center">TO THE FIRST SATIRE.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>The design of the author was to conceal his name and quality. He</i>
<i>lived in the dangerous times of the tyrant Nero, and aims particularly</i>
<i>at him in most of his Satires. For which reason,</i>
<i>though he was a Roman knight, and of a plentiful fortune, he</i>
<i>would appear in this Prologue but a beggarly poet, who writes</i>
<i>for bread. After this, he breaks into the business of the First</i>
<i>Satire; which is chiefly to decry the poetry then in fashion, and</i>
<i>the impudence of those who were endeavouring to pass their stuff</i>
<i>upon the world.</i></p></div>

<h4>THE<br />

FIRST SATIRE.<br />

IN DIALOGUE BETWIXT<br />

THE POET AND HIS FRIEND, OR MONITOR.</h4>


<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>I need not repeat, that the chief aim of the author is against bad</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span><i>poets in this Satire. But I must add, that he includes also bad</i>
<i>orators, who began at that time (as Petronius in the beginning of</i>
<i>his book tells us) to enervate manly eloquence by tropes and figures,</i>
<i>ill placed, and worse applied. Amongst the poets, Persius covertly</i>
<i>strikes at Nero; some of whose verses he recites with scorn and indignation.</i>
<i>He also takes notice of the noblemen, and their abominable</i>
<i>poetry, who, in the luxury of their fortunes, set up for wits and</i>
<i>judges. The Satire is in dialogue betwixt the author, and his friend,</i>
<i>or monitor; who dissuades him from this dangerous attempt of exposing</i>
<i>great men. But Persius, who is of a free spirit, and has</i>
<i>not forgotten that Rome was once a commonwealth, breaks through</i>
<i>all those difficulties, and boldly arraigns the false judgment of the</i>
<i>age in which he lives. The reader may observe, that our poet was</i>
<i>a Stoic philosopher; and that all his moral sentences, both here</i>
<i>and in all the rest of his Satires, are drawn from the dogmas of</i>
<i>that sect.</i></p></div>

<h4>NOTES<br />

ON<br />

TRANSLATIONS FROM PERSIUS.<br />

SATIRE I.</h4>


<h5>Note I.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Should cry up Labeo's stuff, and cry me down.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_208">208</a>.
</p>

<p>Nothing is remaining of Atticus Labeo (so he is called by the
learned Casaubon); nor is he mentioned by any other poet, besides
Persius. Casaubon, from an old commentator on Persius,
says, that he made a very foolish translation of Homer's Iliads.</p>


<h5>Note II.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>They comb, and then they order every hair;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A gown, or white, or scoured to whiteness, wear;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A birth-day jewel bobbing at their ear.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_209">209</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He describes a poet, preparing himself to rehearse his works in
public, which was commonly performed in August. A room was
hired, or lent, by some friend; a scaffold was raised, and a pulpit
placed for him who was to hold forth; who borrowed a new gown,
or scoured his old one, and adorned his ears with jewels, &amp;c.</p>


<h5>Note III.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Know, my wild fig-tree, which in rocks is bred,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Will split the quarry, and shoot out the head.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_209">209</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Trees of that kind grow wild in many parts of Italy, and make
their way through rocks, sometimes splitting the tomb-stones.</p>


<h5>Note IV.</h5>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>In cedar tablets worthy to appear.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_210">210</a>.
</p>

<p>The Romans wrote on cedar and cypress tables, in regard of
the duration of the wood. Ill verses might justly be afraid of
frankincense; for the papers in which they were written, were fit
for nothing but to wrap it up.</p>


<h5>Note V.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Products of citron beds.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_210">210</a>.
</p>

<p>Writings of noblemen, whose bedsteads were of the wood of
citron.</p>


<h5>Note VI.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Hadst thou but, Janus-like, a face behind.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_211">211</a>.
</p>

<p>Janus was the first king of Italy, who refuged Saturn when he
was expelled, by his son Jupiter, from Crete (or, as we now call it,
Candia). From his name the first month of the year is called January.
He was pictured with two faces, one before and one behind;
as regarding the past time and the future. Some of the
mythologists think he was Noah, for the reason given above.</p>


<h5>Note VII.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Where Romulus was bred, and Quintius born.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_212">212</a>.
</p>

<p>He speaks of the country in the foregoing verses; the praises
of which are the most easy theme for poets, but which a bad poet
cannot naturally describe: then he makes a digression to Romulus,
the first king of Rome, who had a rustical education; and
enlarges upon Quintius Cincinnatus, a Roman senator, who was
called from the plough to be dictator of Rome.</p>

<p>Persius here names antitheses, or seeming contradictions;
which, in this place, are meant for rhetorical flourishes, as I think,
with Casaubon.</p>

<p>The story is vulgar, that Midas, king of Phrygia, was made
judge betwixt Apollo and Pan, who was the best musician: he
gave the prize to Pan; and Apollo, in revenge, gave him asses
ears. He wore his hair long to hide them; but his barber discovering
them, and not daring to divulge the secret, dug a hole in
the ground, and whispered into it: the place was marshy; and,
when the reeds grew up, they repeated the words which were spoken
by the barber. By Midas, the poet meant N<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>ero.</p>

<h3>THE<br />

SECOND SATIRE<br />

OF<br />

PERSIUS.<br />

DEDICATED TO HIS FRIEND<br />

PLOTIUS MACRINUS,<br />
ON HIS BIRTH-DAY.</h3>


<p class="center">THE ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>This Satire contains a most grave and philosophical argument, concerning</i>
<i>prayers and wishes. Undoubtedly it gave occasion to Juvenal's</i>
<i>tenth satire; and both of them had their original from one</i>
<i>of Plato's dialogues, called the "Second Alcibiades." Our author</i>
<i>has induced it with great mystery of art, by taking his rise from the</i>
<i>birth-day of his friend; on which occasions, prayers were made, and</i>
<i>sacrifices offered by the native. Persius, commending, first, the purity</i>
<i>of his friend's vows, descends to the impious and immoral requests of</i>
<i>others. The satire is divided into three parts. The first is the exordium</i>
<i>to Macrinus, which the poet confines within the compass of</i>
<i>four verses: the second relates to the matter of the prayers and</i>
<i>vows, and an enumeration of those things, wherein men commonly</i>
<i>sinned against right reason, and offended in their requests: the</i>
<i>third part consists in showing the repugnances of those prayers and</i>
<i>wishes, to those of other men, and inconsistencies with themselves.</i>
<i>He shows the original of these vows, and sharply inveighs against</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span><i>them; and, lastly, not only corrects the false opinion of mankind</i>
<i>concerning them, but gives the true doctrine of all addresses made to</i>
<i>heaven, and how they may be made acceptable to the powers above,</i>
<i>in excellent precepts, and more worthy of a Christian than a Heathen.</i></p></div>

<p>The Romans were used to mark their fortunate days, or any

</div></div>

<p>The ancients thought themselves tainted and polluted by night
itself, as well as bad dreams in the night; and therefore purified
themselves by washing their heads and hands every morning,
which custom the Turks observe to this day.</p>


<h5>Note IV.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Fit for Ergenna's prayer and sacrifice</i>.&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_223">223</a>.
</p>

<p>When any one was thunderstruck, the soothsayer (who is here
called Ergenna) immediately repaired to the place, to expiate the
displeasure of the gods, by sacrificing two sheep.</p>


<h5>Note V.</h5>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Our superstitions with our life begin</i>.&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_223">223</a>.
</p>

<p>The poet laughs at the superstitious ceremonies which the old
women made use of in their lustration, or purification days, when
they named their children, which was done on the eighth day to
females, and on the ninth to males.</p>


<h5>Note VI.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Should some of these, in visions purged from phlegm,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Foretel events, or in a morning dream.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_225">225</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was the opinion both of Grecians and Romans, that the gods,
in visions and dreams, often revealed to their favourites a cure for
their diseases, and sometimes those of others. Thus Alexander
dreamed of an herb which cured Ptolemy. These gods were
principally Apollo and Esculapius; but, in aftertimes, the same
virtue and good-will was attributed to Isis and Osiris. Which
brings to my remembrance an odd passage in Sir Thomas Brown's
Religio Medici, or in his Vulgar Errors; the sense whereof is,
that we are beholden, for many of our discoveries in physic, to
the courteous revelation of spirits. By the expression, of "visions
purged from phlegm," our author means such dreams or visions as
proceed not from natural causes, or humours of the body, but
such as are sent from heaven; and are, therefore, certain remedies.</p>


<h5>Note VII.</h5>

<span class="i0"><i>The priests in temples, now no longer care</i><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Brazen vessels, in which the public treasures of the Romans
were kept: it may be the poet means only old vessels, which were
called &Kappa;&rho;&omicron;&nu;&iota;&alpha;, from the Greek name of Saturn. Note also, that
the Roman treasury was in the temple of Saturn.</p>


<h5>Note VIII.</h5>

<p class="center">----<i>Or Numa's earthen ware.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_225">225</a>.
</p>

<p>Under Numa, the second king of Rome, and for a long time after
him, the holy vessels for sacrifice were of earthen-ware; according
to the superstitious rites which were introduced by the
same Numa: though afterwards, when Memmius had taken Corinth,
and Paulus Emilius had conquered Macedonia, luxury began

<h5>Note IX.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>And makes Calabrian wool, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_225">225</a>.
</p>

<p>The wool of Calabria was of the finest sort in Italy, as Juvenal
also tells us. The Tyrian stain is the purple colour dyed at Tyrus;
and I suppose, but dare not positively affirm, that the richest
of that dye was nearest our crimson, and not scarlet, or that
other colour more approaching to the blue. I have not room to
justify my conjecture.</p>


<h5>Note X.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>As maids to Venus offer baby-toys.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_225">225</a>.
</p>

<p>Those baby-toys were little babies, or poppets, as we call them;
in Latin, pup&aelig;; which the girls, when they came to the age of
puberty, or child bearing, offered to Venus; as the boys, at fourteen
or fifteen, offered their <i>bull&aelig;</i>, or bosses.</p>


<h5>Note XI.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>A cake, thus given, is worth a hecatomb.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_226">226</a>.
</p>

<p>A cake of barley, or coarse wheat-meal, with the bran in it.
The meaning is, that God is pleased with the pure and spotless
heart of the offerer, and not with the riches of the offering. Laberius,
in the fragments of his "Mimes," has a verse like this&mdash;<i>Puras,</i>
<i>Deus, non plenas aspicit manus</i>.&mdash;What I had forgotten before, in
its due place, I must here tell the reader, that the first half of this
satire was translated by one of my sons, now in Italy; but I
thought so well of it, that I let it pass without any alteration.</p>

<h3>THE<br />

THIRD SATIRE<br />

OF<br />

PERSIUS.</h3>


<p class="center">THE ARGUMENT.
</p>


<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>Our author has made two Satires concerning study, the first and the</i>
<i>third: the first related to men; this to young students, whom he desired</i>
<i>to be educated in the Stoic philosophy. He himself sustains the</i>
<i>person of the master, or preceptor, in this admirable Satire, where</i>
<i>he upbraids the youth of sloth, and negligence in learning. Yet he begins</i>
<i>with one scholar reproaching his fellow-students with late rising to</i>
<i>their books. After which, he takes upon him the other part of the teacher;</i>
<i>and, addressing himself particularly to young noblemen, tells them,</i>
<i>that, by reason of their high birth, and the great possessions of their</i>
<i>fathers, they are careless of adorning their minds with precepts of</i>
<i>moral philosophy: and, withal, inculcates to them the miseries</i>
<i>which will attend them in the whole course of their life, if they do</i>
<i>not apply themselves betimes to the knowledge of virtue, and the end</i>
<i>of their creation, which he pathetically insinuates to them. The title</i>
<i>of this satire, in some ancient manuscripts, was, "the Reproach of Idleness;"</i>
<i>though in others of the scholiasts it is inscribed, "Against</i>
<i>the Luxury and Vices of the Rich." In both of which, the intention</i>
<i>of the poet is pursued, but principally in the former.</i></p>

<p>[I remember I translated this satire when I was a king's scholar at
Westminster school, for a Thursday-night's exercise; and believe, that
it, and many other of my exercises of this nature in English verse, are
still in the hands of my learned master, the Rev. Dr Busby.]</p></div>

<h4>NOTES<br />

ON<br />

TRANSLATIONS FROM PERSIUS.<br />

SATIRE III.</h4>


<h5>Note I.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>And parchment with the smoother side displayed.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_231">231</a>.
</p>

<p>The students used to write their notes on parchments; the inside,
on which they wrote, was white; the other side was hairy,
and commonly yellow. Quintilian reproves this custom, and advises
rather table-books, lined with wax, and a stile, like that we
use in our vellum table-books, as more easy.</p>


<h5>Note II.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>A fuming-pan thy Lares to appease.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_232">232</a>.
</p>

<p>Before eating, it was customary to cut off some part of the
meat, which was first put into a pan, or little dish, then into the
fire, as an offering to the household gods: this they called a Libation.</p>


<h5>Note III.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Drawn from the root of some old Tuscan tree.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_232">232</a>.
</p>

<p>The Tuscans were accounted of most ancient nobility. Horace
observes this in most of his compliments to M&aelig;cenas, who was
derived from the old kings of Tuscany; now the dominion of the
Great Duke.</p>


<h5>Note IV.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Who, clad in purple, canst thy censor greet.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_232">232</a>.
</p>

<p>The Roman knights, attired in the robe called <i>trabea</i>, were
summoned by the censor to appear before him, and to salute him
in passing by, as their names were called over. They led their
horses in their hand. See more of this in Pompey's Life, written
by Plutarch.</p>


<h5>Note V.</h5>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Sicilian tortures, and the brazen bull.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_233">233</a>.
</p>

<p>Some of the Sicilian kings were so great tyrants, that the name
is become proverbial. The brazen bull is a known story of Phalaris,
one of those tyrants, who, when Perillus, a famous artist,
had presented him with a bull of that metal hollowed within,
which, when the condemned person was inclosed in it, would render
the sound of a bull's roaring, caused the workman to make
the first experiment,&mdash;<i>docuitque suum mugire juvencum</i>.</p>


<h5>Note VI.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The wretch, who, sitting at his plenteous board,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Looked up, and viewed on high the pointed sword.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_233">233</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He alludes to the story of Damocles, a flatterer of one of those
Sicilian tyrants, namely Dionysius. Damocles had infinitely extolled
the happiness of kings: Dionysius, to convince him of the
contrary, invited him to a feast, and clothed him in purple; but
caused a sword, with the point downward, to be hung over his
head by a silken twine; which, when he perceived, he could eat
nothing of the delicates that were set before him.</p>


<h5>Note VII.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Thou in the Stoic-porch, severely bred.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_233">233</a>.
</p>

<p>The Stoics taught their philosophy under a porticus, to secure
their scholars from the weather. Zeno was the chief of that sect.</p>


<h5>Note VIII.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Where on the walls, by Polygnotus' hand,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The conquered Medians in trunk-breeches stand.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_233">233</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Polygnotus, a famous painter, who drew the pictures of the
Medes and Persians, conquered by Miltiades, Themistocles, and
other Athenian captains, on the walls of the portico, in their natural
habits.</p>


<h5>Note IX.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>And where the Samian Y directs thy steps to run</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To Virtue's narrow steep, and broad-way Vice to shun.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_234">234</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Pythagoras, of Samos, made the allusion of the Y, or Greek
<i>upsilon</i>, to Vice and Virtue. One side of the letter being broad,
characters Vice, to which the ascent is wide and easy; the other
side represents Virtue, to which the passage is strait and difficult;
and perhaps our Saviour might also allude to this, in those noted
words of the evangelist, "The way to heaven," &amp;c.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<h5>Note X.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Fat fees from the defended Umbrian draws.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_235">235</a>.
</p>

<p>Casaubon here notes, that, among all the Romans, who were
brought up to learning, few, besides the orators or lawyers, grew
rich.</p>


<h5>Note XI.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>His heels stretched out, and pointing to the gate.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_237">237</a>.
</p>

<p>The Romans were buried without the city; for which reason,
the poet says, that the dead man's heels were stretched out towards
the gate.</p>


<h5>Note XII.</h5>

<p class="center">----<i>Mad Orestes.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_238">238</a>.
</p>

<p>Orestes was son to Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. Agamemnon,
at his return from the Trojan wars, was slain by &AElig;gysthus,
the adulterer of Clytemnestra. Orestes, to revenge his father's
death, slew both &AElig;gysthus and his mother; for which he was
punished with madness by the Eumenides, or Furies, who continually
haunted him.</p>

<h3>THE<br />

FOURTH SATIRE<br />

OF<br />

PERSIUS.</h3>


<p class="center">THE ARGUMENT.
</p>


<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>Our author, living in the time of Nero, was contemporary and friend</i>
<i>to the noble poet Lucan. Both of them were sufficiently sensible,</i>
<i>with all good men, how unskilfully he managed the commonwealth;</i>
<i>and perhaps might guess at his future tyranny, by some passages, during</i>
<i>the latter part of his first five years; though he broke not out</i>
<i>into his great excesses, while he was restrained by the counsels and authority</i>
<i>of Seneca. Lucan has not spared him in the poem of his</i>
<i>Pharsalia; for his very compliment looked asquint, as well as</i>
<i>Nero.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Persius has been bolder, but with caution likewise. For</i>
<i>here, in the person of young Alcibiades, he arraigns his ambition of</i>
<i>meddling with state-affairs without judgment, or experience. It is</i>
<i>probable, that he makes Seneca, in this satire, sustain the part of</i>
<i>Socrates, under a borrowed name; and, withal, discovers some secret</i>
<i>vices of Nero, concerning his lust, his drunkenness, find his effeminacy,</i>
<i>which had not yet arrived to public notice. He also reprehends</i>
<i>the flattery of his courtiers, who endeavoured to make all</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span><i>his vices pass for virtues. Covetousness was undoubtedly none of</i>
<i>his faults; but it is here described as a veil cast over the true meaning</i>
<i>of the poet, which was to satirize his prodigality and voluptuousness;</i>
<i>to which he makes a transition. I find no instance in</i>
<i>history of that emperor's being a Pathic, though Persius seems to</i>
<i>brand him with it. From the two dialogues of Plato, both called</i>
<i>"Alcibiades," the poet took the arguments of the second and third satires;</i>
<i>but he inverted the order of them, for the third satire is taken</i>
<i>from the first of those dialogues.</i></p>

<p><i>The commentators before Casaubon were ignorant of our author's secret</i>
<i>meaning; and thought he had only written against young noblemen</i>
<i>in general, who were too forward in aspiring to public magistracy;</i>
<i>but this excellent scholiast has unravelled the whole mystery,</i>
<i>and made it apparent, that the sting of the satire was particularly</i>
<i>aimed at Nero.</i></p></div>

<h4>NOTES<br />

ON<br />

TRANSLATIONS FROM PERSIUS.<br />

SATIRE IV.</h4>


<h5>Note I.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Socrates.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_243">243</a>.
</p>

<p>Socrates, whom the oracle of Delphos praised as the wisest
man of his age, lived in the time of the Peloponnesian war. He,
finding the uncertainty of natural philosophy, applied himself
wholly to the moral. He was master to Xenophon and Plato,
and to many of the Athenian young noblemen; amongst the rest
to Alcibiades, the most lovely youth then living; afterwards a famous
captain, whose life is written by Plutarch.</p>


<h5>Note II.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Tell me, thou pupil to great Pericles,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Our second hope, my Alcibiades.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_243">243</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Pericles was tutor, or rather overseer, of the will of Clinias, father
to Alcibiades. While Pericles lived, who was a wise man,
and an excellent orator, as well as a great general, the Athenians
had the better of the war.</p>


<h5>Note III.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Can'st punish crimes.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_244">244</a>.
</p>

<p>That is, by death. When the judges would condemn a malefactor,
they cast their votes into an urn; as, according to the modern
custom, a balloting-box. If the suffrages were marked with
&Theta;, they signified the sentence of death to the offender; as being the
first letter of &Theta;&#x1F71;&nu;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;, which, in English, is death.</p>


<h5>Note IV.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Drink hellebore.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_244">244</a>.
</p>

<p>The poet would say, that such an ignorant young man, as he
here describes, is fitter to be governed himself than to govern
others. He therefore advises him to drink hellebore, which purges
the brain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<h5>Note V.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Say, dost thou know Vectidius?</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_245">245</a>.
</p>

<p>The name of Vectidius is here used appellatively, to signify any
rich covetous man, though perhaps there might be a man of that
name then living. I have translated this passage paraphrastically,
and loosely; and leave it for those to look on, who are not unlike
the picture.</p>


<h5>Note VI.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>When he should thanks to Pan and Pales pay,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And better Ceres.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_245">245</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Pan, the god of shepherds, and Pales, the goddess presiding over
rural affairs; whom Virgil invocates in the beginning of his second
Georgic. I give the epithet of <i>better</i> to Ceres, because
she first taught the use of corn for bread, as the poets tell us;
men, in the first rude ages, feeding only on acorns, or mast, instead
of bread.</p>


<h5>Note VII.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Not five, the strongest that the Circus breeds.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_246">246</a>.
</p>

<p>The learned Holyday (who has made us amends for his bad poetry
in this and the rest of these satires, with his excellent illustrations),
here tells us, from good authority, that the number five
does not allude to the five fingers of one man, but to five strong
men, such as were skilful in the five robust exercises then in practice
at Rome, and were performed in the circus, or public place
ordained for them. These five he reckons up in this manner:
1. The C&aelig;stus, or Whirlbatts, described by Virgil in his fifth
&AElig;neid; and this was the most dangerous of all the rest. The 2d
was the foot-race. The 3d, the discus; like the throwing a weighty
ball; a sport now used in Cornwall, and other parts of England;
we may see it daily practised in Red-Lyon Fields. The
4th, was the Saltus, or Leaping; and the 5th, wrestling naked,
and besmeared with oil. They who practised in these five manly
exercises were called &Pi;&#x1F73;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&theta;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;.</p>


<h5>Note VIII.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>If, with thy guards, thou scour'st the streets by night,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And dost in murders, rapes, and spoils, delight.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_247">247</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Persius durst not have been so bold with Nero as I dare now;
and therefore there is only an intimation of that in him which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
I publicly speak: I mean, of Nero's walking the streets by night
in disguise, and committing all sorts of outrages, for which he
was sometimes well beaten.</p>


<h5>Note IX.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12"><i>Not what thou dost appear,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But what thou art, and find the beggar there.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_247">247</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Look into thyself, and examine thy own conscience; there thou
shalt find, that, how wealthy soever thou appearest to the world,
yet thou art but a beggar; because thou art destitute of all virtues,
which are the riches of the soul. This also was a paradox
of the Stoic school.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>

<h3>THE<br />

FIFTH SATIRE<br />

OF<br />

PERSIUS.<br />

INSCRIBED TO<br />

THE REV. DR BUSBY.<br />
THE SPEAKERS<br />

PERSIUS AND CORNUTUS.</h3>


<p class="center">THE ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>The judicious Casaubon, in his proem to this Satire, tells us, that</i>
<i>Aristophanes, the grammarian, being asked, what poem of Archilochus'</i>
<i>Iambics he preferred before the rest; answered, the</i>
<i>longest. His answer may justly be applied to this Fifth Satire;</i>
<i>which, being of a greater length than any of the rest, is also by</i>
<i>far the most instructive. For this reason I have selected it from</i>
<i>all the others, and inscribed it to my learned master, Dr Busby;</i>
<i>to whom I am not only obliged myself for the best part of my own</i>
<i>education, and that of my two sons; but have also received from</i>
<i>him the first and truest taste of Persius. May he be pleased to</i>
<i>find, in this translation, the gratitude, or at least some small acknowledgment,</i>
<i>of his unworthy scholar, at the distance of forty-two</i>
<i>years from the time when I departed from under his tuition.</i>
<i>This Satire consists of two distinct parts: The first contains the</i>
<i>praises of the stoic philosopher, Cornutus, master and tutor to</i>
<i>our Persius; it also declares the love and piety of Persius to</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span><i>his well-deserving master; and the mutual friendship which continued</i>
<i>betwixt them, after Persius was now grown a man; as</i>
<i>also his exhortation to young noblemen, that they would enter</i>
<i>themselves into his institution. From hence he makes an artful</i>
<i>transition into the second part of his subject; wherein he first</i>
<i>complains of the sloth of scholars, and afterwards persuades</i>
<i>them to the pursuit of their true liberty. Here our author excellently</i>
<i>treats that paradox of the Stoics, which affirms, that the</i>
<i>wise or virtuous man is only free, and that all vicious men are</i>
<i>naturally slaves; and, in the illustration of this dogma, he</i>
<i>takes up the remaining part of this inimitable Satire.</i></p></div>

<h4>NOTES<br />

ON<br />

TRANSLATIONS FROM PERSIUS.<br />

SATIRE V.</h4>


<h5>Note I.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Progne.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_252">252</a>.
</p>

<p>Progne was wife to Tereus, king of Thracia. Tereus fell in
love with Philomela, sister to Progne, ravished her, and cut out
her tongue; in revenge of which, Progne killed Itys, her own son
by Tereus, and served him up at a feast, to be eaten by his father.</p>


<h5>Note II.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Thyestes.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_252">252</a>.
</p>

<p>Thyestes and Atreus were brothers, both kings. Atreus, to
revenge himself of his unnatural brother, killed the sons of Thyestes,
and invited him to eat them.</p>


<h5>Note III.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>When first my childish robe resigned the charge.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_253">253</a>.
</p>

<p>By the childish robe, is meant the Pr&oelig;texta, or first gowns
which the Roman children of quality wore. These were welted
with purple; and on those welts were fastened the bull&aelig;, or little
bells; which, when they came to the age of puberty, were hung
up, and consecrated to the Lares, or Household Gods.</p>


<h5>Note IV.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>And my white shield proclaimed my liberty.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_253">253</a>.
</p>

<p>The first shields which the Roman youths wore were white,
and without any impress or device on them, to shew they had yet
achieved nothing in the wars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>
<h5>Note V.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>And by my better Socrates was bred.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_253">253</a>.
</p>

<p>Socrates, by the oracle, was declared to be the wisest of mankind:
he instructed many of the Athenian young noblemen in morality,
and amongst the rest Alcibiades.</p>


<h5>Note VI.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sure on our birth some friendly planet shone;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And, as our souls, our horoscope was one.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_254">254</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Astrologers divide the heaven into twelve parts, according to
the number of the twelve signs of the zodiac. The sign, or constellation,
which rises in the east at the birth of any man, is called
the Ascendant: Persius therefore judges, that Cornutus and he
had the same, or a like nativity.</p>


<h5>Note VII.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>And both have Saturn's rage, repelled by Jove.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_254">254</a>.
</p>

<p>Astrologers have an axiom, that whatsoever Saturn ties is loosed
by Jupiter. They account Saturn to be a planet of a malevolent
nature, and Jupiter of a propitious influence.</p>

<h5>Note VIII.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>The Stoic institutes.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_255">255</a>.
</p>

<p>Zeno was the great master of the Stoic philosophy; and Cleanthes
was second to him in reputation. Cornutus, who was master
or tutor to Persius, was of the same school.</p>


<h5>Note IX.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Not that which bondmen from their masters find,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The privilege of doles.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_255">255</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When a slave was made free, he had the privilege of a Roman
born, which was to have a share in the donatives, or doles of
bread, &amp;c. which were distributed by the magistrates among the
people.</p>


<h5>Note X.</h5>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">&mdash;&mdash;<i>Nor yet to inscribe</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Their names in this or t'other Roman tribe.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_255">255</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Roman people was distributed into several tribes. He who
was made free was enrolled into some one of them; and thereupon
enjoyed the common privileges of a Roman citizen.</p>


<h5>Note XI.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Slaves are made citizens by turning round.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_255">255</a>.
</p>

<p>The master, who intended to enfranchize a slave, carried him
before the city pr&aelig;tor, and turned him round, using these words,
"I will that this man be free."</p>


<h5>Note XII.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Now Marcus Dama is his worship's name.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_256">256</a>.
</p>

<p>Slaves had only one name before their freedom; after it they
were admitted to a pr&aelig;nomen, like our christened names: so
Dama is now called Marcus Dama.</p>


<h5>Note XIII.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>A will is to be proved;&mdash;put in your claim;</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>'Tis clear, if Marcus has subscribed his name.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_256">256</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the proof of a testament, the magistrates were to subscribe
their names, as allowing the legality of the will.</p>


<h5>Note XIV.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>What farther can we from our caps receive,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Than as we please without controul to live.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_256">256</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Slaves, when they were set free, had a cap given them, in sign
of their liberty.</p>


<h5>Note XV.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Noble Brutus.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_256">256</a>.
</p>

<p>Brutus freed the Roman people from the tyranny of the Tarquins,
and changed the form of the government into a glorious
commonwealth.</p>


<h5>Note XVI.</h5>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Excepting still the letter of the law.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_256">256</a>.
</p>

<p>The text of the Roman laws was written in red letters, which
was called the Rubric; translated here, in more general words,
"The letter of the law."</p>


<h5>Note XVII.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>The Stoics held this paradox, that any one vice, or notorious
folly, which they called madness, hindered a man from being virtuous;
that a man was of a piece, without a mixture, either
wholly vicious, or good; one virtue or vice, according to them,
including all the rest.</p>

<p>The pr&aelig;tor held a wand in his hand, with which he softly
struck the slave on the head, when he declared him free.</p>

him.</p>

<p>He who sued for any office amongst the Romans, was called a
candidate, because he wore a white gown; and sometimes chalked
it, to make it appear whiter. He rose early, and went to the
levees of those who headed the people; saluted also the tribes severally,
when they were gathered together to chuse their magistrates;
and distributed a largess amongst them, to engage them
for their voices; much resembling our elections of Parliamentmen.</p>

<p class="center">----<i>On Herod's day.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_260">260</a>.
</p>

<p>The commentators are divided what Herod this was, whom our
author mentions; whether Herod the Great, whose birth-day
might possibly be celebrated, after his death, by the Herodians, a
sect amongst the Jews, who thought him their Messiah; or Herod
Agrippa, living in the author's time, and after it. The latter
seems the more probable opinion.</p>


<h5>Note XXII.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Then a cracked egg-shell thy sick fancy frights.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_260">260</a>.
</p>

<p>The ancients had a superstition, contrary to ours, concerning
egg-shells: they thought, that if an egg-shell were cracked, or a
hole bored in the bottom of it, they were subject to the power of
sorcery. We as vainly break the bottom of an egg-shell, and cross
it when we have eaten the egg, lest some hag should make use
of it in bewitching us, or sailing over the sea in it, if it were
whole. The rest of the priests of Isis, and her one-eyed or squinting
priestess, is more largely treated in the sixth satire of Juvenal,
where the superstitions of women are related.</p>

<h3>THE<br />

SIXTH SATIRE<br />

OF<br />

PERSIUS.<br />
TO<br />

C&AElig;SIUS BASSUS,<br />

A LYRIC POET.</h3>

<p class="center">THE ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>This Sixth Satire treats an admirable common-place of moral philosophy,</i>
<i>of the true use of riches. They are certainly intended</i>
<i>by the Power who bestows them, as instruments and helps of living</i>
<i>commodiously ourselves; and of administering to the wants of</i>
<i>others, who are oppressed by fortune. There are two extremes in</i>
<i>the opinions of men concerning them. One error, though on the</i>
<i>right hand, yet a great one, is, that they are no helps to a virtuous</i>
<i>life; the other places all our happiness in the acquisition and</i>
<i>possession of them; and this is undoubtedly the worse extreme.</i>
<i>The mean betwixt these, is the opinion of the Stoics, which is, that</i>
<i>riches may be useful to the leading a virtuous life; in case we</i>
<i>rightly understand how to give according to right reason, and</i>
<i>how to receive what is given us by others. The virtue of giving</i>
<i>well, is called liberality; and it is of this virtue that Persius</i>
<i>writes in this satire, wherein he not only shows the lawful use of</i>
<i>riches, but also sharply inveighs against the vices which are opposed</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span><i>to it; and especially of those, which consist in the defects</i>
<i>of giving, or spending, or in the abuse of riches. He writes to</i>
<i>C&aelig;sius Bassus, his friend, and a poet also. Enquires first of his</i>
<i>health and studies; and afterwards informs him of his own, and</i>
<i>where he is now resident. He gives an account of himself, that</i>
<i>he is endeavouring, by little and little, to wear off his vices; and,</i>
<i>particularly, that he is combating ambition, and the desire of</i>
<i>wealth. He dwells upon the latter vice; and being sensible, that</i>
<i>few men either desire, or use, riches as they ought, he endeavours</i>
<i>to convince them of their folly, which is the main design of the</i>
<i>whole satire.</i></p></div>

<h4>NOTES<br />

ON<br />

TRANSLATIONS FROM PERSIUS.<br />

SATIRE VI.</h4>


<h5>Note I.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Has winter caused thee, friend, to change thy seat,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And seek in Sabine air a warm retreat.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_268">268</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All the studious, and particularly the poets, about the end of
August, began to set themselves on work, refraining from writing
during the heats of the summer. They wrote by night, and sat
up the greatest part of it; for which reason the product of their
studies was called their elucubrations, or nightly labours. They
who had country-seats retired to them while they studied, as Persius
did to his, which was near the port of the Moon in Etruria;
and Bassus to his, which was in the country of the Sabines, nearer
Rome.</p>


<h5>Note II.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Now sporting on thy lyre the loves of youth.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_268">268</a>.
</p>

<p>This proves C&aelig;sius Bassus to have been a lyric poet. It is said
of him, that by an eruption of the flaming mountain Vesuvius,
near which the greatest part of his fortune lay, he was burnt himself,
together with all his writings.</p>


<h5>Note III.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Who in a drunken dream beheld his soul</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The fifth within the transmigrating roll.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_269">269</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I call it a drunken dream of Ennius; not that my author, in this
place, gives me any encouragement for the epithet, but because Horace,
and all who mention Ennius, say he was an excessive drinker of
wine. In a dream, or vision, call you it which you please, he thought
it was revealed to him, that the soul of Pythagoras was transmigrated
into him; as Pythagoras before him believed, that himself had
been Euphorbus in the wars of T<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>roy. Commentators differ in
placing the order of this soul, and who had it first. I have here
given it to the peacock; because it looks more according to the
order of nature, that it should lodge in a creature of an inferior
species, and so by gradation rise to the informing of a man. And
Persius favours me, by saying, that Ennius was the fifth from the
Pythagorean peacock.</p>


<h5>Note IV.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>My friend is shipwrecked on the Brutian strand.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_270">270</a>.
</p>

<p>Perhaps this is only a fine transition of the poet, to introduce
the business of the satire; and not that any such accident had
happened to one of the friends of Persius. But, however, this is
the most poetical description of any in our author; and since he
and Lucan were so great friends, I know not but Lucan might
help him in two or three of these verses, which seem to be written
in his style; certain it is, that besides this description of a shipwreck,
and two lines more, which are at the end of the second satire,
our poet has written nothing elegantly. I will, therefore,
transcribe both the passages, to justify my opinion. The following
are the last verses, saving one, of the second satire:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Compositum jus, fasque animi; sanctosque recessus</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Mentis, et incoctum generoso pectus honesto.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The others are those in this present satire, which are subjoined:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----<i>trabe rupta, Bruttia Saxa</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Prendit amicus inops, remque omnem, surdaque vota</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Condidit Ionio: jacet ipse in littore; et una</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ingentes de puppe Dei: jamque obvia mergis</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Costa ratis lacer&aelig;.</i>&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h5>Note V.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>From thy new hope, and from thy growing store,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Now lend assistance, and relieve the poor.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_270">270</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Latin is, <i>Nunc et de cespite vivo, frange aliquid</i>. Casaubon
only opposes the <i>cespes vivus</i>, which, word for word, is the
living turf, to the harvest, or annual income; I suppose the poet
rather means, sell a piece of land already sown, and give the money
of it to my friend, who has lost all by shipwreck; that is, do
not stay till thou hast reaped, but help him immediately, as his
wa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>nts require.</p>


<h5>Note VI.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Nor beg with a blue table on his back.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_270">270</a>.
</p>

<p>Holyday translates it a green table: the sense is the same; for
the table was painted of the sea-colour, which the shipwrecked
person carried on his back, expressing his losses, thereby to excite
the charity of the spectators.</p>


<h5>Note VII.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Or without spices lets thy body burn.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_270">270</a>.
</p>

<p>The bodies of the rich, before they were burnt, were embalmed
with spices; or rather spices were put into the urn with the relics
of the ashes. Our author here names cinnamum and cassia,
which cassia was sophisticated with cherry-gum, and probably
enough by the Jews, who adulterate all things which they sell.
But whether the ancients were acquainted with the spices of the
Molucca Islands, Ceylon, and other parts of the Indies, or whether
their pepper and cinnamon, &amp;c. were the same with ours, is
another question. As for nutmegs and mace, it is plain that the
Latin names for them are modern.</p>


<h5>Note VIII.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>C&aelig;sar salutes the queen and senate thus:</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My arms are on the Rhine victorious.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_271">271</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The C&aelig;sar, here mentioned, is Caius Caligula, who affected to
triumph over the Germans, whom he never conquered, as he did
over the Britons; and accordingly sent letters, wrapt about with
laurels, to the senate and the Empress C&aelig;sonia, whom I here call
queen; though I know that name was not used amongst the Romans;
but the word empress would not stand in that verse, for
which reason I adjourned it to another. The dust, which was to
be swept away from the altars, was either the ashes which were
left there after the last sacrifice for victory, or might perhaps
mean the dust or ashes which were left on the altars since some
former defeat of the Romans by the Germans; after which overthrow,
the altars had been neglected.</p>


<h5>Note IX.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>The goodly empress.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_271">271</a>.
</p>

<p>C&aelig;sonia, wife to Caius Caligula, who afterwards, in the re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>ign of
Claudius, was proposed, but ineffectually, to be married to him,
after he had executed Messalina for adultery.</p>


<h5>Note X.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The captive Germans, of gigantic size,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Are ranked in order, and are clad in frize.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_271">271</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He means only such as were to pass for Germans in the triumph,
large-bodied men, as they are still, whom the empress clothed
new with coarse garments, for the greater ostentation of the
victory.</p>


<h5>Note XI.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Know, I have vowed two hundred gladiators.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_271">271</a>.
</p>

<p>A hundred pair of gladiators were beyond the purse of a private
man to give; therefore this is only a threatening to his heir,
that he could do what he pleased with his estate.</p>


<h5>Note XII.</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----<i>Shouldst thou demand of me</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My torch, when I in course run after thee.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_272">272</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Why shouldst thou, who art an old fellow, hope to outlive me,
and be my heir, who am much younger? He who was first in the
course or race, delivered the torch, which he carried, to him who
was second.</p>


<h5>Note XIII.</h5>

<p class="center"><i>Well fed, and fat as Cappadocian slaves.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_273">273</a>.
</p>

<p>Who were famous for their lustiness, and being, as we call it, in
good liking. They were set on a stall when they were exposed to
sale, to show the good habit of their body; and made to play
tricks before the buyers, to show their activity and strength.</p>


<h5>Note XIV.</h5>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>
<p class="center"><i>Then say, Chrysippus.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_273">273</a>.
</p>

<p>Chrysippus, the Stoic, invented a kind of argument, consisting
of more than three propositions, which is called <i>sorites</i>, or a heap.
But as Chrysippus could never bring his propositions to a certain
stint, so neither can a covetous man bring his craving desires to
any certain measure of riches, beyond which he could not wish for
any more.</p>

<h2>THE<br />

WORKS OF VIRGIL,<br />

TRANSLATED<br />

INTO ENGLISH VERSE.</h2>


<p class="ph2">WORKS OF VIRGIL.</p>

<p>This grea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>t work was undertaken by Dryden, in 1694, and published,
by subscription, in 1697. One hundred and one subscribers
gave five guineas each to furnish the engravings for the work;
if indeed this was any thing more than a genteel pretext for increasing
the profit of the author; for Spence has informed us,
that the old plates used for Ogleby's "Virgil," were retouched
for that of his great successor. Another class of subscribers, two
hundred and fifty-two in number, contributed two guineas each.
As the names of those who encouraged this great national labour
have some claim to distinction, the reader will find, prefixed to
this edition, an accurate copy of both lists, as they stand in the
first folio edition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a><br /><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>. On 28th June, 1697, the following advertisement
appeared in the London Gazette:</p>

<p>"The Works of Virgil; containing his Pastorals, Georgics, and
Eneis, translated into English verse, by Mr Dryden, and adorned
with one hundred cuts, will be finished this week, and be ready
next week to be delivered, as subscribed for, in quires, upon
bringing the receipt for the first payment, and paying the second.
Printed for Jacob Tonson, &amp;c."</p>

<p>In 1709, Tonson published a second edition of Dryden's "Virgil,"
with the plates reduced, in three volumes, 8vo; and various
others have since appeared. In 1803, a new edition was given to
the public, revised and corrected by Henry Carey, LL.D. This
is so correct, that, although it has been uniformly compared with
the original edition of Tonson, I have thought it advisable to
follow the modern editor in some corrections of the punctuation
and reading. In other cases, where I have adhered to the
folio, I have placed Dr Carey's alteration at the bottom of the
page. It is hardly worth while to notice, that there is a slight alteration
of the arrangement of Dryden's prolegomena; the Dedication
to the "Pastorals" being placed immediately before that
class of poems, instead of preceding the Life, as in the original
folio. Dryden's Notes and Observations, which, in the original,
are printed together at the end of the work, are, in this edition,
dispersed and subjoined to the different Books containing the
passages to which they refer.</p>

<h3>RECOMMENDATORY POEMS.</h3>


<h4>TO<br />

MR DRYDEN,<br />

ON HIS EXCELLENT<br />

<i>TRANSLATION OF VIRGIL</i>.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whene'er great Virgil's lofty verse I see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pompous scene charms my admiring eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There different beauties in perfection meet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thoughts as proper, as the numbers sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, when wild Fancy mounts a daring height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Judgment steps in, and moderates her flight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wisely he manages his wealthy store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still says enough, and yet implies still more:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, though the weighty sense be closely wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reader's left to improve the pleasing thought.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hence we despaired to see an English dress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should e'er his nervous energy express;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For who could that in fettered rhyme inclose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, without loss, can scarce be told in prose?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But you, great Sir, his manly genius raise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make your copy share an equal praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! how I see thee, in soft scenes of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renew those passions he alone could move!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here Cupid's charms are with new art exprest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pale Eliza leaves her peaceful rest&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaves her Elysium, as if glad to live,          <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">To love, and wish, to sigh, despair, and grieve, <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">And die again for him that would again deceive.  <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor does the mighty Trojan less appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than Mars himself, amidst the storms of war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now his fierce eyes with double fury glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a new dread attends the impending blow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Daunian chiefs their eager rage abate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, though unwounded, seem to feel their fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Long the rude fury of an ignorant age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With barbarous spite, profaned his sacred page.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heavy Dutchmen, with laborious toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrested his sense, and cramped his vigorous style.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No time, no pains, the drudging pedants spare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still his shoulders must the burden bear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, through the mazes of their comments led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We learn, not what he writes, but what they read.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, through these shades of undistinguished night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appeared some glimmering intervals of light;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Till mangled by a vile translating sect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like babes by witches <i>in effigie</i> rackt:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Ogleby, mature in dulness, rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Holbourn doggrel, and low chiming prose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His strength and beauty did at once depose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now the magic spell is at an end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since even the dead, in you, have found a friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You free the bard from rude oppressors' power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grace his verse with charms unknown before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, doubly thus obliged, must doubting stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which chiefly should his gratitude command&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether should claim the tribute of his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The patron's bounty, or the poet's art.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Alike with wonder and delight we viewed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Roman genius in thy verse renewed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw thee raise soft Ovid's amorous fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fit the tuneful Horace to thy lyre:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw new gall embitter Juvenal's pen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crabbed Persius made politely plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Virgil alone was thought too great a task&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What you could scarce perform, or we durst ask;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A task, which Waller's Muse could ne'er engage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A task, too hard for Denham's stronger rage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure of success, they some slight sallies tried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the fenced coast their bold attempts defied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fear, their o'ermatched forces back they drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quitting the province Fate reserved for you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain thus Philip did the Persians storm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A work his son was destined to perform.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O! had Roscommon<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> lived to hail the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sing loud P&aelig;ans through the crowded way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When you in Roman majesty appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which none know better, and none come so near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The happy author would with wonder see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His rules were only prophecies of thee:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, were he now to give translators light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'd bid them only read thy work, and write.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For this great task, our loud applause is due;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We own old favours, but must press for new:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' expecting world demands one labour more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy loved Homer does thy aid implore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To right his injured works, and set them free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the lewd rhymes of grovelling Ogleby.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shall his verse in graceful pomp appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor will his birth renew the ancient jar:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On those Greek cities we shall look with scorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in our Britain think the poet born.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Missing their native sun,&mdash;at best retain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a faint odour, and but live with pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Roman poetry, by moderns taught,            <span class="linenum">}<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></span>

<span class="i0">While we transfuse, the nimble spirit flies,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Who then attempts to shew the ancients' wit,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whence we conclude from thy translated song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So just, so warm, so smooth, and yet so strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou heavenly charmer! soul of harmony!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all their geniuses revived in thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy trumpet sounds: the dead are raised to light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New-born they rise, and take to heaven their flight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deck'd in thy verse, as clad with rays, they shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All glorified, immortal, and divine.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As Britain, in rich soil abounding wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Furnished for use, for luxury, and pride,<br /></span>

<h3>THE<br />

LIFE<br />

OF<br />

PUBLIUS VIRGILIUS MARO,</h3>

<p class="center">BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD, D.D.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>Virgil was born at Mantua, which city was built
no less than three hundred years before Rome, and
was the capital of the New Hetruria, as himself,
no less antiquary than poet, assures us. His birth
is said to have happened in the first consulship of
Pompey the Great, and Licinius Crassus: but, since
the relater of this presently after contradicts himself,
and Virgil's manner of addressing to Octavius
implies a greater difference of age than that of seven
years, as appears by his First Pastoral, and
other places, it is reasonable to set the date of it
something backward; and the writer of his Life having
no certain memorials to work upon, seems to
have pitched upon the two most illustrious consuls
he could find about that time, to signalize the birth
of so eminent a man. But it is beyond all question,
that he was born on or near the 15th of October,
which day was kept festival in honour of his memory
by the Latin, as the birth-day of Homer was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>by the Greek poets. And so near a resemblance
there is betwixt the lives of these two famous epic
writers, that Virgil seems to have followed the fortune
of the other, as well as the subject and manner
of his writing. For Homer is said to have been
of very mean parents, such as got their bread by
day-labour; so is Virgil. Homer is said to be base-born;
so is Virgil. The former to have been born
in the open air, in a ditch, or by the bank of a river;
so is the latter. There was a poplar planted
near the place of Virgil's birth, which suddenly
grew up to an unusual height and bulk, and to
which the superstitious neighbourhood attributed
marvellous virtue: Homer had his poplar too, as
Herodotus relates, which was visited with great veneration.
Homer is described by one of the ancients
to have been of a slovenly and neglected
mien and habit; so was Virgil. Both were of a
very delicate and sickly constitution; both addicted
to travel, and the study of astrology; both had
their compositions usurped by others; both envied
and traduced during their lives. We know not so
much as the true names of either of them with any
exactness; for the critics are not yet agreed how
the word <i>Virgil</i> should be written, and of Homer's
name there is no certainty at all. Whosoever shall
consider this parallel in so many particulars, (and
more might be added,) would be inclined to think,
that either the same stars ruled strongly at the nativities
of them both; or, what is a great deal more
probable, that the Latin grammarians, wanting materials
for the former part of Virgil's life, after the
legendary fashion, supplied it out of Herodotus;
and, like ill face-painters, not being able to hit the
true features, endeavoured to make amends by a
great deal of impertinent landscape and drapery.</p>

<p>Without troubling the reader with needless quotat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>ions
now, or afterwards, the most probable opinion
is, that Virgil was the son of a servant, or assistant,
to a wandering astrologer, who practised
physic: for <i>medicus</i>, <i>magus</i>, as Juvenal observes,
usually went together; and this course of life was
followed by a great many Greeks and Syrians, of
one of which nations it seems not improbable that
Virgil's father was. Nor could a man of that profession
have chosen a fitter place to settle in, than
that most superstitious tract of Italy, which, by her
ridiculous rites and ceremonies, as much enslaved
the Romans, as the Romans did the Hetrurians by
their arms. This man, therefore, having got together
some money, which stock he improved by his
skill in planting and husbandry, had the good fortune,
at last, to marry his master's daughter, by
whom he had Virgil: and this woman seems, by
her mother's side, to have been of good extraction;
for she was nearly related to Quintilius Varus,
whom Paterculus assures us to have been of an illustrious,
though not patrician, family; and there
is honourable mention made of it in the history of
the second Carthaginian war. It is certain, that
they gave him very good education; to which they
were inclined, not so much by the dreams of his
mother, and those presages which Donatus relates,
as by the early indications which he gave of a sweet
disposition and excellent wit. He passed the first
seven years of his life at Mantua, not seventeen, as
Scaliger miscorrects his author; for the <i>initia &aelig;tatis</i>
can hardly be supposed to extend so far. From
thence he removed to Cremona, a noble Roman colony,
and afterwards to Milan; in all which places,
he prosecuted his studies with great application.
He read over all the best Latin and Greek authors;
for which he had convenience by the no remote
distance of Marseilles, that famous Greek colony,
which maintained its politeness and pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>ity of language
in the midst of all those barbarous nations
amongst which it was seated; and some tincture
of the latter seems to have descended from them
down to the modern French. He frequented the
most eminent professors of the Epicurean philosophy,
which was then much in vogue, and will be
always, in declining and sickly states.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> But, finding
no satisfactory account from his master Syron,
he passed over to the Academic school; to which
he adhered the rest of his life, and deserved, from
a great emperor, the title of&mdash;<i>The Plato of Poets</i>.
He composed at leisure hours a great number of
verses on various subjects; and, desirous rather of
a great than early fame, he permitted his kinsman
and fellow-student, Varus, to derive the honour of
one of his tragedies to himself. Glory, neglected
in proper time and place, returns often with large
increase: and so he found it; for Varus afterwards
proved a great instrument of his rise. In short, it
was here that he formed the plan, and collected the
materials, of all those excellent pieces which he afterwards
finished, or was forced to leave less perfect
by his death. But, whether it were the unwholesomeness
of his native air, of which he somewhere
complains; or his too great abstinence, and
night-watchings at his study, to which he was always
addicted, as Augustus observes; or possibly
the hopes of improving himself by travel&mdash;he resolved
to remove to the more southern tract of Italy;
and it was hardly possible for him not to take Rome
in his way, as is evident to any one who shall cast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>an eye on the map of Italy. And therefore the late
French editor of his works is mistaken, when he
asserts, that he never saw Rome till he came to petition
for his estate. He gained the acquaintance
of the master of the horse to Octavius, and cured a
great many diseases of horses, by methods they had
never heard of. It fell out, at the same time, that
a very fine colt, which promised great strength and
speed, was presented to Octavius; Virgil assured
them, that he came of a faulty mare, and would
prove a jade: Upon trial, it was found as he had
said. His judgment proved right in several other
instances; which was the more surprising, because
the Romans knew least of natural causes of any civilized
nation in the world; and those meteors and
prodigies, which cost them incredible sums to expiate,
might easily have been accounted for by no
very profound naturalist. It is no wonder, therefore,
that Virgil was in so great reputation, as to
be at last introduced to Octavius himself. That
prince was then at variance with Marc Antony,
who vexed him with a great many libelling letters,
in which he reproaches him with the baseness of
his parentage, that he came of a scrivener, a rope-maker,
and a baker, as Suetonius tells us. Octavius
finding that Virgil had passed so exact a judgment
upon the breed of dogs and horses, thought that he
possibly might be able to give him some light concerning
his own. He took him into his closet,
where they continued in private a considerable time.
Virgil was a great mathematician; which, in the
sense of those times, took in astrology; and, if
there be any thing in that art, (which I can hardly
believe,) if that be true which the ingenious De la
Chambre asserts confidently, that, from the marks
on the body, the configuration of the planets at a
nativity may be gathered, and the marks might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> be
told by knowing the nativity, never had one of
those artists a fairer opportunity to show his skill
than Virgil now had; for Octavius had moles upon
his body, exactly resembling the constellation called
<i>Ursa Major</i>. But Virgil had other helps; the
predictions of Cicero and Catulus,<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> and that vote
of the senate had gone abroad, that no child, born
at Rome in the year of his nativity, should be bred
up, because the seers assured them that an emperor
was born that year. Besides this, Virgil had heard
of the Assyrian and Egyptian prophecies, (which,
in truth, were no other but the Jewish,) that about
that time a great king was to come into the world.
Himself takes notice of them, (&AElig;n. VI.) where he
uses a very significant word, now in all liturgies,
<i>hujus in adventu</i>; so in another place, <i>adventu propiore</i>
<i>Dei</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At his foreseen approach already quake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assyrian kingdoms, and M&aelig;otis' lake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nile hears him knocking at his seven-fold gate.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Every one knows whence this was taken. It was
rather a mistake than impiety in Virgil, to apply
these prophecies, which belonged to the Saviour of
the world, to the person of Octavius; it being
a usual piece of flattery, for near a hundred years
together, to attribute them to their emperors and
other great men. Upon the whole matter, it is
very probable, that Virgil predicted to him the empire
at this time. And it will appear yet the more,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>if we consider, that he assures him of his being received
into the number of the gods, in his First
Pastoral, long before the thing came to pass;
which prediction seems grounded upon his former
mistake. This was a secret not to be divulged
at that time; and therefore it is no wonder that
the slight story in Donatus was given abroad to
palliate the matter. But certain it is, that Octavius
dismissed him with great marks of esteem, and
earnestly recommended the protection of Virgil's
affairs to Pollio, then lieutenant of the Cisalpine
Gaul, where Virgil's patrimony lay. This Pollio,
from a mean original, became one of the most
considerable persons of his time; a good general,
orator, statesman, historian, poet, and favourer of
learned men; above all, he was a man of honour
in those critical times. He had joined with Octavius
and Antony in revenging the barbarous assassination
of Julius C&aelig;sar; when they two were at
variance, he would neither follow Antony, whose
courses he detested, nor join with Octavius against
him, out of a grateful sense of some former obligations.
Augustus, who thought it his interest to
oblige men of principles, notwithstanding this, received
him afterwards into favour, and promoted
him to the highest honours. And thus much I
thought fit to say of Pollio, because he was one of
Virgil's greatest friends. Being therefore eased of
domestic cares, he pursues his journey to Naples.
The charming situation of that place, and view of
the beautiful villas of the Roman nobility, equaling
the magnificence of the greatest kings; the
neighbourhood of Bai&aelig;, whither the sick resorted
for recovery, and the statesman when he was politicly
sick; whither the wanton went for pleasure,
and witty men for good company; the wholesomeness
of the air, and improving conversation, the
best air of all, contributed not only to the re-establishing
his health, but to the forming of his style,
and rendering him master of that happy turn of
verse, in which he much surpasses all the Latins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
and, in a less advantageous language, equals even
Homer himself. He proposed to use his talent in
poetry, only for scaffolding to build a convenient
fortune, that he might prosecute, with less interruption,
those nobler studies to which his elevated genius
led him, and which he describes in these admirable
lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Me vero primum dulces ante omnia Mus&aelig;,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Quarum sacra fero ingenti percussus amore,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Accipiant; c&aelig;lique vias, et sidera, monstrent,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Defectus Solis varios, Lun&aelig;que labores;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Unde tremor terris</i>, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the current of that martial age, by some
strange antiperistasis, drove so violently towards
poetry, that he was at last carried down with the
stream; for not only the young nobility, but Octavius,
and Pollio, Cicero in his old age, Julius
C&aelig;sar, and the stoical Brutus, a little before, would
needs be tampering with the Muses. The two latter
had taken great care to have their poems curiously
bound, and lodged in the most famous libraries;
but neither the sacredness of those places, nor
the greatness of their names, could preserve ill poetry.
Quitting therefore the study of the law, after
having pleaded but one cause with indifferent success,
he resolved to push his fortune this way, which
he seems to have discontinued for some time; and
that may be the reason why the <i>Culex</i>, his first pastoral
now extant, has little besides the novelty of
the subject, and the moral of the fable, which contains
an exhortation to gratitude, to recommend it.
Had it been as correct as his other pieces, nothing
more proper and pertinent could have at that time
been addressed to the young Octavius; for, the
year in which he presented it, probably at Bai&aelig;,
seems to be the very same in which that p<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>rince consented
(though with seeming reluctance) to the
death of Cicero, under whose consulship he was
born, the preserver of his life, and chief instrument
of his advancement. There is no reason to question
its being genuine, as the late French editor does;
its meanness, in comparison of Virgil's other works,
(which is that writer's only objection,) confutes himself;
for Martial, who certainly saw the true copy,
speaks of it with contempt; and yet that pastoral
equals, at least, the address to the Dauphin, which
is prefixed to the late edition. Octavius, to unbend
his mind from application to public business, took
frequent turns to Bai&aelig;, and Sicily, where he composed
his poem called <i>Sicelides</i>, which Virgil seems
to allude to in the pastoral beginning <i>Sicelides Mus&aelig;</i>.
This gave him opportunity of refreshing that prince's
memory of him; and about that time he wrote his
<i>&AElig;tna</i>. Soon after he seems to have made a voyage
to Athens, and at his return presented his <i>Ceiris</i>, a
more elaborate piece, to the noble and eloquent
Messala. The forementioned author groundlessly
taxes this as supposititious; for, besides other critical
marks, there are no less than fifty or sixty verses,
altered, indeed, and polished, which he inserted in
the Pastorals, according to his fashion; and from
thence they were called <i>Eclogues</i>, or <i>Select Bucolics</i>:
we thought fit to use a title more intelligible, the
reason of the other being ceased; and we are supported
by Virgil's own authority, who expressly
calls them <i>carmina pastorum</i>. The French editor
is again mistaken, in asserting, that the <i>Ceiris</i> is borrowed
from the ninth of Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>: he
might have more reasonably conjectured it to be
taken from Parthenius, the Greek poet, from whom
Ovid borrowed a great part of his work. But it is
indeed taken from neither, but from that learned,
unfortunate poet, Apollonius Rhodius, to whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
Virgil is more indebted than to any other Greek
writer, excepting Homer. The reader will be satisfied
of this, if he consults that author in his own
language; for the translation is a great deal more
obscure than the original.</p>

<p>Whilst Virgil thus enjoyed the sweets of a learned
privacy, the troubles of Italy cut off his little subsistence;
but, by a strange turn of human affairs,
which ought to keep good men from ever despairing,
the loss of his estate proved the effectual way
of making his fortune. The occasion of it was
this: Octavius, as himself relates, when he was but
nineteen years of age, by a masterly stroke of policy,
had gained the veteran legions into his service,
and, by that step, outwitted all the republican senate.
They grew now very clamorous for their pay;
the treasury being exhausted, he was forced to
make assignments upon land; and none but in Italy
itself would content them. He pitched upon Cremona,
as the most distant from Rome; but that not
sufficing, he afterwards threw in part of the state of
Mantua. Cremona was a rich and noble colony,
settled a little before the invasion of Hannibal.
During that tedious and bloody war, they had done
several important services to the commonwealth;
and, when eighteen other colonies, pleading poverty
and depopulation, refused to contribute money,
or to raise recruits, they of Cremona voluntarily
paid a double quota of both. But past services are
a fruitless plea; civil wars are one continued act of
ingratitude. In vain did the miserable mothers,
with their famishing infants in their arms, fill the
streets with their numbers, and the air with lamentations;
the craving legions were to be satisfied at
any rate. Virgil, involved in the common calamity,
had recourse to his old patron, Pollio; but he was,
at this time, under a cloud; however, compassiona<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>ting
so worthy a man, not of a make to struggle
through the world, he did what he could, and recommended
him to M&aelig;cenas, with whom he still
kept a private correspondence. The name of this
great man being much better known than one part
of his character, the reader, I presume, will not be
displeased if I supply it in this place.</p>

<p>Though he was of as deep reach, and easy dispatch
of business, as any in his time, yet he designedly
lived beneath his true character. Men
had oftentimes meddled in public affairs, that they
might have more ability to furnish for their pleasures:
M&aelig;cenas, by the honestest hypocrisy that
ever was, pretended to a life of pleasure, that he
might render more effectual service to his master.
He seemed wholly to amuse himself with the diversions
of the town, but, under that mask, was the
greatest minister of his age. He would be carried
in a careless, effeminate posture through the streets
in his chair, even to the degree of a proverb; and
yet there was not a cabal of ill-disposed persons
which he had not early notice of, and that too in a
city as large as London and Paris, and perhaps two
or three more of the most populous, put together.
No man better understood that art so necessary to
the great&mdash;the art of declining envy. Being but
of a gentleman's family, not patrician, he would
not provoke the nobility by accepting invidious honours,
but wisely satisfied himself, that he had the
ear of Augustus, and the secret of the empire. He
seems to have committed but one great fault, which
was, the trusting a secret of high consequence to his
wife; but his master, enough uxorious himself,
made his own frailty more excusable, by generously
forgiving that of his favourite: he kept, in all his
greatness, exact measures with his friends; and,
chusing them wisely, found, by experience, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
good sense and gratitude are almost inseparable.
This appears in Virgil and Horace. The former,
besides the honour he did him to all posterity, re-toured
his liberalities at his death; the other, whom
M&aelig;cenas recommended with his last breath, was
too generous to stay behind, and enjoy the favour
of Augustus; he only desired a place in his tomb,
and to mingle his ashes with those of his deceased
benefactor. But this was seventeen hundred years
ago.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> Virgil, thus powerfully supported, thought it
mean to petition for himself alone, but resolutely
solicits the cause of his whole country, and seems,
at first, to have met with some encouragement;
but, the matter cooling, he was forced to sit down
contented with the grant of his own estate. He
goes therefore to Mantua, produces his warrant to
a captain of foot, whom he found in his house.
Arius, who had eleven points of the law, and
fierce<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> of the services he had rendered to Octavius,
was so far from yielding possession, that, words
growing betwixt them, he wounded him dangerously,
forced him to fly, and at last to swim the
river Mincius to save his life. Virgil, who used to
say, that no virtue was so necessary as patience,
was forced to drag a sick body half the length of
Italy, back again to Rome, and by the way, probably,
composed his Ninth Pastoral, which may seem
to have been made up in haste, out of the fragments
of some other pieces; and naturally enough represents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>the disorder of the poet's mind, by its disjointed
fashion, though there be another reason to be
given elsewhere of its want of connection. He
handsomely states his case in that poem, and, with
the pardonable resentments of injured innocence,
not only claims Octavius's promise, but hints to
him the uncertainty of human greatness and glory.
All was taken in good part by that wise prince; at
last effectual orders were given. About this time,
he composed that admirable poem, which is set first,
out of respect to C&aelig;sar; for he does not seem either
to have had leisure, or to have been in the humour
of making so solemn an acknowledgment, till he
was possessed of the benefit. And now he was in
so great reputation and interest, that he resolved to
give up his land to his parents, and himself to the
court. His Pastorals were in such esteem, that
Pollio, now again in high favour with C&aelig;sar, desired
him to reduce them into a volume. Some
modern writer, that has a constant flux of verse,
would stand amazed, how Virgil could employ three
whole years in revising five or six hundred verses,
most of which, probably, were made some time before;
but there is more reason to wonder, how he
could do it so soon in such perfection. A coarse
stone is presently fashioned; but a diamond, of not
many carats, is many weeks in sawing, and, in polishing,
many more. He who put Virgil upon this,
had a politic good end in it.</p>

<p>The continued civil wars had laid Italy almost
waste; the ground was uncultivated and unstocked;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>upon which ensued such a famine and insurrection,
that C&aelig;sar hardly escaped being stoned at Rome;
his ambition being looked upon by all parties as
the principal occasion of it. He set himself therefore
with great industry to promote country improvements;
and Virgil was serviceable to his design,
as the good Keeper of the Bees, Georg. iv.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Tinnitusque cie, et Matris quate cymbala circum,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ips&aelig; consident.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That emperor afterwards thought it matter worthy
a public inscription&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS&mdash;
</p>

<p>which seems to be the motive that induced M&aelig;cenas
to put him upon writing his Georgics, or books
of husbandry: a design as new in Latin verse, as
pastorals, before Virgil, were in Italy: which work
took up seven of the most vigorous years of his
life; for he was now, at least, thirty-four years of
age; and here Virgil shines in his meridian. A
great part of this work seems to have been rough-drawn
before he left Mantua; for an ancient writer
has observed, that the rules of husbandry, laid
down in it, are better calculated for the soil of
Mantua, than for the more sunny climate of Naples;
near which place, and in Sicily, he finished it. But,
lest his genius should be depressed by apprehensions
of want, he had a good estate settled upon
him, and a house in the pleasantest part of Rome;
the principal furniture of which was a well-chosen
library, which stood open to all comers of learning
and merit: and what recommended the situation of
it most, was the neighbourhood of his M&aelig;cenas;
and thus he could either visit Rome, or return to
his privacy at Naples, through a pleasant road,
adorned on each side with pieces of antiquity, of
which he was so great a lover, and, in the inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>vals
of them, seemed almost one continued street of
three days' journey.</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar, having now vanquished Sextus Pompeius,
(a spring-tide of prosperities breaking in upon him,
before he was ready to receive them as he ought,)
fell sick of the <i>imperial evil</i>, the desire of being
thought something more than man. Ambition is
an infinite folly; when it has attained to the utmost
pitch of human greatness, it soon falls to making
pretensions upon heaven. The crafty Livia would
needs be drawn in the habit of a priestess by the
shrine of the new god; and this became a fashion
not to be dispensed with amongst the ladies. The
devotion was wonderous great amongst the Romans;
for it was their interest, and, which sometimes avails
more, it was the mode. Virgil, though he despised
the heathen superstitions, and is so bold as to call
Saturn and Janus by no better a name than that of
<i>old men</i>, and might deserve the title of subverter of
superstitions, as well as Varro, thought fit to follow
the maxim of Plato his master, that every one
should serve the gods after the usage of his own
country; and therefore was not the last to present
his incense, which was of too rich a composition
for such an altar; and, by his address to C&aelig;sar on
this occasion, made an unhappy precedent to Lucan
and other poets which came after him.&mdash;<i>Georg. i.</i>
and <i>iii.</i> And this poem being now in great forwardness,
C&aelig;sar, who, in imitation of his predecessor
Julius, never intermitted his studies in the
camp, and much less in other places, refreshing
himself by a short stay in a pleasant village of Campania
would needs be entertained with the rehearsal
of some part of it. Virgil recited with a marvellous
grace, and sweet accent of voice, but his
lungs failing him, M&aelig;cenas himself supplied his
place for what remained. Such a piece of condesce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>nsion
would now be very surprising; but it was
no more than customary amongst friends, when
learning passed for quality.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> L&aelig;lius, the second
man of Rome in his time, had done as much for
that poet, out of whose dross Virgil would sometimes
pick gold, as himself said, when one found
him reading Ennius; (the like he did by some verses
of Varro, and Pacuvius, Lucretius, and Cicero,
which he inserted into his works.) But learned
men then lived easy and familiarly with the great:
Augustus himself would sometimes sit down betwixt
Virgil and Horace, and say jestingly, that he
sat betwixt sighing and tears, alluding to the asthma
of one, and rheumatic eyes of the other. He would
frequently correspond with them, and never leave a
letter of theirs unanswered; nor were they under
the constraint of formal superscriptions in the beginning,
nor of violent superlatives at the close, of
their letter: the invention of these is a modern refinement;
in which this may be remarked, in passing,
that "<i>humble servant</i>" is respect, but "<i>friend</i>"
an affront; which notwithstanding implies the former,
and a great deal more. Nor does true greatness
lose by such familiarity; and those who have
it not, as M&aelig;cenas and Pollio had, are not to be
accounted proud, but rather very discreet, in their
reserves. Some playhouse beauties do wisely to be
seen at a distance, and to have the lamps twinkle
betwixt them and the spectators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>But now C&aelig;sar, who, though he were none of
the greatest soldiers, was certainly the greatest traveller,
of a prince, that had ever been, (for which
Virgil so dexterously compliments him, &AElig;neid, vi.)
takes a voyage to Egypt, and, having happily finished
the war, reduces that mighty kingdom into the
form of a province, over which he appointed Gallus
his lieutenant. This is the same person to whom
Virgil addresses his Tenth Pastoral; changing, in
compliance to his request, his purpose of limiting
them to the number of the Muses. The praises of
this Gallus took up a considerable part of the Fourth
Book of the Georgics, according to the general consent
of antiquity: but C&aelig;sar would have it put out;
and yet the seam in the poem is still to be discerned;
and the matter of Arist&aelig;us's recovering his bees
might have been dispatched in less compass, without
fetching the causes so far, or interesting so
many gods and goddesses in that affair. Perhaps
some readers may be inclined to think this, though
very much laboured, not the most entertaining part
of that work; so hard it is for the greatest masters
to paint against their inclination. But C&aelig;sar was
contented, that he should be mentioned in the last
Pastoral, because it might be taken for a satirical
sort of commendation; and the character he there
stands under, might help to excuse his cruelty, in
putting an old servant to death for no very great
crime.</p>

<p>And now having ended, as he begins his Georgics,
with solemn mention of C&aelig;sar, (an argument of his
devotion to him,) he begins his <i>&AElig;ne&iuml;s</i>, according
to the common account, being now turned of forty.
But that work had been, in truth, the subject of
much earlier meditation. Whilst he was working
upon the first book of it, this passage, so very remarkable
in history, fell out, in which Virgil had a
great share.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>C&aelig;sar, about this time, either cloyed with glory,
or terrified by the example of his predecessor, or
to gain the credit of moderation with the people, or
possibly to feel the pulse of his friends, deliberated
whether he should retain the sovereign power, or
restore the commonwealth. Agrippa, who was a
very honest man, but whose view was of no great
extent, advised him to the latter; but M&aelig;cenas,
who had thoroughly studied his master's temper, in
an eloquent oration gave contrary advice. That
emperor was too politic to commit the oversight of
Cromwell, in a deliberation something resembling
this. Cromwell had never been more desirous of
the power, than he was afterwards of the title, of
king; and there was nothing in which the heads of
the parties, who were all his creatures, would not
comply with him; but, by too vehement allegation
of arguments against it, he, who had outwitted
every body besides, at last outwitted himself by
too deep dissimulation; for his council, thinking to
make their court by assenting to his judgment,
voted unanimously for him against his inclination;
which surprised and troubled him to such a degree,
that, as soon as he had got into his coach, he fell
into a swoon.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> But C&aelig;sar knew his people better;
and, his council being thus divided, he asked Virgil's
advice. Thus a poet had the honour of determining
the greatest point that ever was in debate,
betwixt the son-in-law and favourite of C&aelig;sar.
Virgil delivered his opinion in words to this effect:</p>

<p>"The change of a popular into an absolute government
has generally been of very ill consequence;
for, betwixt the hatred of the people and injustice
of the prince, it, of necessity, comes to pass, that
they live in distrust, and mutual apprehensions.
But, if the commons knew a just person, whom
they entirely confided in, it would be for the adv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>antage
of all parties, that such a one should be
their sovereign; wherefore, if you shall continue to
administer justice impartially, as hitherto you have
done, your power will prove safe to yourself, and
beneficial to mankind." This excellent sentence,
which seems taken out of Plato, (with whose writings
the grammarians were not much acquainted,
and therefore cannot reasonably be suspected
of forgery in this matter,) contains the true state of
affairs at that time: for the commonwealth maxims
were now no longer practicable; the Romans had
only the haughtiness of the old commonwealth left,
without one of its virtues. And this sentence we
find, almost in the same words, in the First Book
of the "&AElig;ne&iuml;s," which at this time he was writing;
and one might wonder that none of his commentators
have taken notice of it. He compares a tempest
to a popular insurrection, as Cicero had compared
a sedition to a storm, a little before:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ac veluti, magno in populo, cum s&aelig;pe coorta est</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Seditio, s&aelig;vitque animis ignobile vulgus,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Jamque faces, et saxa volant; furor arma ministrat:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tum pietate gravem ac meritis si forte virum quem</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Conspexere, silent, arrectisque auribus adstant:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ille regit dictis animos, et pectora mulcet.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Piety and merit were the two great virtues which
Virgil every where attributes to Augustus, and in
which that prince, at least politicly, if not so truly,
fixed his character, as appears by the <i>Marmor Ancyr.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>and several of his medals. Franshemius, the
learned supplementor of Livy, has inserted this relation
into his history; nor is there any good reason,
why Ru&aelig;us should account it fabulous. The
title of a poet in those days did not abate, but
heighten, the character of the gravest senator.
Virgil was one of the best and wisest men of his
time, and in so popular esteem, that one hundred
thousand Romans rose when he came into the
theatre, and paid him the same respect they used
to C&aelig;sar himself, as Tacitus assures us. And, if
Augustus invited Horace to assist him in writing
his letters, (and every body knows that the "<i>Rescripta</i>
<i>Imperatorum</i>" were the laws of the empire,)
Virgil might well deserve a place in the cabinet-council.</p>

<p>And now he prosecutes his "&AElig;ne&iuml;s," which had
anciently the title of the "Imperial Poem," or "Roman
History," and deservedly: for, though he were
too artful a writer to set down events in exact historical
order, for which Lucan is justly blamed;
yet are all the most considerable affairs and persons
of Rome comprised in this poem. He deduces the
history of Italy from before Saturn to the reign of
King Latinus; and reckons up the successors of
&AElig;neas, who reigned at Alba, for the space of three
hundred years, down to the birth of Romulus; describes
the persons and principal exploits of all the
kings, to their expulsion, and the settling of the
commonwealth. After this, he touches promiscuously
the most remarkable occurrences at home
and abroad, but insists more particularly upon the
exploits of Augustus; insomuch that, though this
assertion may appear at first a little surprising, he
has in his works deduced the history of a considerable
part of the world from its original, through
the fabulous and heroic ages, through the monarchy
and commonwealth of Rome, for the space of
four thousand years, down to within less than forty
of our Saviour's time, of whom he has preserved a
most illustrious prophecy. Besides this, he points
at many remarkable passages of history under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
feigned names: the destruction of Alba and Veii,
under that of Troy; the star Venus, which, Varro
says, guided &AElig;neas in his voyage to Italy, in that
verse,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Matre de&acirc; monstrante viam.</i>
</p>

<p>Romulus's lance taking root, and budding, is described
in that passage concerning Polydorus, &AElig;ne&iuml;d,
iii.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&mdash;&mdash;<i>Confixum ferrea texit</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Telorum seges, et jaculis increvit acutis</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The stratagem of the Trojans boring holes in their
ships, and sinking them, lest the Latins should
burn them, under that fable of their being transformed
into sea-nymphs; and therefore the ancients
had no such reason to condemn that fable as
groundless and absurd. Cocles swimming the river
Tyber, after the bridge was broken down behind
him, is exactly painted in the four last verses
of the ninth book, under the character of Turnus:
Marius hiding himself in the morass of Minturn&aelig;,
under the person of Sinon:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Limosoque lacu per noctem obscurus in ulv&acirc;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Delitui</i>.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Those verses in the second book concerning Priam,</p>

<p class="center">----<i>jacet ingens littore truncus, &amp;c.</i>
</p>

<p>seem originally made upon Pompey the Great.
He seems to touch the imperious and intriguing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
humour of the Empress Livia, under the character
of Juno. The irresolute and weak Lepidus is well
represented under the person of King Latinus;
Augustus with the character of <i>Pont. Max.</i> under
that of &AElig;neas; and the rash courage (always unfortunate
in Virgil) of Marc Antony, in Turnus;
the railing eloquence of Cicero in his "Philippics"
is well imitated in the oration of Drances; the
dull faithful Agrippa, under the person of Achates;
accordingly this character is flat: Achates kills but
one man, and himself receives one slight wound,
but neither says nor does any thing very considerable
in the whole poem. Curio, who sold his
country for about two hundred thousand pounds,
is stigmatized in that verse,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Vendidit hic auro patriam, dominumque potentem</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Imposuit.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Livy relates, that, presently after the death of the
two Scipios in Spain, when Martius took upon him
the command, a blazing meteor shone around his
head, to the astonishment of his soldiers. Virgil
transfers this to &AElig;neas:</p>

<p class="center"><i>L&aelig;tasque vomunt duo tempora flammas.</i>
</p>

<p>It is strange, that the commentators have not taken
notice of this. Thus the ill omen which happened
a little before the battle of Thrasymen, when some
of the centurions' lances took fire miraculously, is
hinted in the like accident which befel Acestes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>before the burning of the Trojan fleet in Sicily.
The reader will easily find many more such instances.
In other writers, there is often well-covered
ignorance; in Virgil, concealed learning.</p>

<p>His silence of some illustrious persons is no less
worth observation. He says nothing of Sc&aelig;vola,
because he attempted to assassinate a king, though
a declared enemy; nor of the younger Brutus; for
he effected what the other endeavoured; nor of the
younger Cato, because he was an implacable enemy
of Julius C&aelig;sar; nor could the mention of him
be pleasing to Augustus; and that passage,</p>

<p class="center"><i>His dantem jura Catonem</i>&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>may relate to his office, as he was a very severe
censor. Nor would he name Cicero, when the occasion
of mentioning him came full in his way,
when he speaks of Catiline; because he afterwards
approved the murder of C&aelig;sar, though the plotters
were too wary to trust the orator with their design.
Some other poets knew the art of speaking well;
but Virgil, beyond this, knew the admirable secret,
of being eloquently silent. Whatsoever was most
curious in Fabius Pictor, Cato the elder, Varro, in
the Egyptian antiquities, in the form of sacrifice, in
the solemnities of making peace and war, is preserved
in this poem. Rome is still above ground,
and flourishing in Virgil. And all this he performs
with admirable brevity. The "&AElig;ne&iuml;s" was once near
twenty times bigger than he left it; so that he spent
as much time in blotting out, as some moderns
have done in writing whole volumes. But not one
book has his finishing strokes. The sixth seems
one of the most perfect, the which, after long entreaty,
and sometimes threats, of Augustus, he was
at last prevailed upon to recite. This fell out about
four years before his own death: that of Marcellus,
whom C&aelig;sar designed for his successor, happened
a little before this recital: Virgil therefore, with
his usual dexterity, inserted his funeral panegyric
in those admirable lines, beginning,</p>

<p class="center"><i>O nate, ingentem luctum ne qu&aelig;re tuorum, &amp;c.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>His mother, the excellent Octavia, the best wife of
the worst husband that ever was, to divert her
grief, would be of the auditory. The poet artificially
deferred the naming Marcellus, till their
passions were raised to the highest; but the mention
of it put both her and Augustus into such a
passion of weeping, that they commanded him to
proceed no further. Virgil answered, that he had
already ended that passage. Some relate, that Octavia
fainted away; but afterwards she presented
the poet with two thousand one hundred pounds,
odd money: a round sum for twenty-seven verses;
but they were Virgil's. Another writer says, that,
with a royal magnificence, she ordered him massy
plate, unweighed, to a great value.</p>

<p>And now he took up a resolution of travelling
into Greece, there to set the last hand to this work;
proposing to devote the rest of his life to philosophy,
which had been always his principal passion.
He justly thought it a foolish figure for a grave man
to be overtaken by death, whilst he was weighing
the cadence of words, and measuring verses, unless
necessity should constrain it, from which he
was well secured by the liberality of that learned
age. But he was not aware, that, whilst he allotted
three years for the revising of his poem, he drew
bills upon a failing bank: for, unhappily meeting
Augustus at Athens, he thought himself obliged to
wait upon him into Italy; but, being desirous to
see all he could of the Greek antiquities, he fell
into a languishing distemper at Megara. This,
neglected at first, proved mortal. The agitation of
the vessel (for it was now autumn, near the time
of his birth,) brought him so low, that he could
hardly reach Brindisi. In his sickness, he frequently,
and with great importunity, called for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
scrutoir, that he might burn his "&AElig;ne&iuml;s:" but,
Augustus interposing by his royal authority, he
made his last will, (of which something shall be
said afterwards;) and, considering probably how
much Homer had been disfigured by the arbitrary
compilers of his works, obliged Tucca and Varius
to add nothing, nor so much as fill up the breaks
he left in his poem. He ordered that his bones
should be carried to Naples, in which place he had
passed the most agreeable part of his life. Augustus,
not only as executor and friend, but according
to the duty of the <i>Pontifex Maximus</i>, when a
funeral happened in his family, took care himself to
see the will punctually executed. He went out of
the world with all that calmness of mind with
which the ancient writer of his life says he came
into it; making the inscription of his monument
himself; for he began and ended his poetical compositions
with an epitaph. And this he made, exactly
according to the law of his master Plato on
such occasions, without the least ostentation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I sung flocks, tillage, heroes; Mantua gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me life, Brundusium death, Naples a grave.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h4>A SHORT<br />

ACCOUNT<br />

OF HIS<br />

PERSON, MANNERS, AND FORTUNE.</h4>

<p>He was of a very swarthy complexion, which might
proceed from the southern extraction of his fath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>er;
tall and wide-shouldered, so that he may be thought
to have described himself under the character of
Mus&aelig;us, whom he calls the best of poets&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----<i>Medium nam plurima turba</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hunc habet, atque humeris extantem suspicit altis.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His sickliness, studies, and the troubles he met
with, turned his hair gray before the usual time.
He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> had a hesitation in his speech, as many other
great men; it being rarely found that a very fluent
elocution, and depth of judgment, meet in the
same person: his aspect and behaviour rustic and
ungraceful; and this defect was not likely to be
rectified in the place where he first lived, nor afterwards,
because the weakness of his stomach
would not permit him to use his exercises. He
was frequently troubled with the head-ach, and
spitting of blood; spare of diet, and hardly drank
any wine. Bashful to a fault; and, when people
crowded to see him, he would slip into the next
shop, or by-passage, to avoid them. As this character
could not recommend him to the fair sex, he
seems to have as little consideration for them as
Euripides himself. There is hardly the character of
one good woman to be found in his poems: he uses
the word <i>mulier</i> but once in the whole "&AElig;ne&iuml;s,"
then too by way of contempt, rendering literally a
piece of a verse out of Homer. In his "Pastorals,"
he is full of invectives against love: in the "Georgics,"
he appropriates all the rage of it to the females.
He makes Dido, who never deserved that
character, lustful and revengeful to the utmost degree,
so as to die devoting her lover to destruction;
so changeable, that the Destinies themselves
could not fix the time of her death; but Iris, the
emblem of inconstancy, must determine it. Her
sister is something worse.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> He is so far from passing
such a compliment upon Helen, as the grave
old counsellor in Homer does, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> nine years' war,
when, upon the sight of her, he breaks out into
this rapture, in the presence of king Priam:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">None can the cause of these long wars despise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cost bears no proportion to the prize:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Majestic charms in every feature shine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her air, her port, her accent, is divine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However, let the fatal beauty go, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Virgil is so far from this complaisant humour, that
his hero falls into an unmanly and ill-timed deliberation,
whether he should not kill her in a church;<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
which directly contradicts what Deiphobus says of
her, &AElig;neid vi., in that place where every body tells
the truth. He transfers the dogged silence of
Ajax's ghost to that of Dido; though that be no
very natural character to an injured lover, or a
woman. He brings in the Trojan matrons setting
their own fleet on fire, and running afterwards,
like witches on their <i>sabbat</i>, into the woods. He
bestows indeed some ornaments on the character
of Camilla; but soon abates his favour, by calling
her <i>aspera</i> and <i>horrenda virgo</i>: he places her in
the front of the line for an ill omen of the battle,
as one of the ancients has observed. We may observe,
on this occasion, it is an art peculiar to Virgil,
to intimate the event by some preceding accident.
He hardly ever describes the rising of the
sun, but with some circumstance which fore-signifies
the fortune of the day. For instance, when
&AElig;neas leaves Africa and Queen Dido, he thus describes
the fatal morning:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Tithoni croceum linquens Aurora cubile.</i>
</p>

<p>[And, for the remark, we stand indebted to the
curious pencil of Pollio.] The Mourning Fields
(&AElig;neid vi.) are crowded with ladies of a lost reputation:
hardly one man gets admittance; and that
is C&aelig;neus, for a very good reason. Latinus's queen
is turbulent and ungovernable, and at last hangs
herself: and the fair Lavinia is disobedient to the
oracle, and to the king, and looks a little flickering
after Turnus. I wonder at this the more, because
Livy represents her as an excellent person, and who
behaved herself with great wisdom in her regency
during the minority of her son; so that the poet
has done her wrong, and it reflects on her posterity.
His goddesses make as ill a figure: Juno is always
in a rage, and the Fury of heaven; Venus grows so
unreasonably confident, as to ask her husband to
forge arms for her bastard son, which were enough
to provoke one of a more phlegmatic temper than
Vulcan was. Notwithstanding all this raillery of
Virgil's, he was certainly of a very amorous disposition,
and has described all that is most delicate in
the passion of love: but he conquered his natural
inclination by the help of philosophy, and refined
it into friendship, to which he was extremely sensible.
The reader will admit of or reject the following
conjecture, with the free leave of the writer,
who will be equally pleased either way. Virgil had
too great an opinion of the influence of the heavenly
bodies: and, as an ancient writer says, he was
born under the sign of Virgo; with which nativity
he much pleased himself, and would exemplify her
virtues in his life. Perhaps it was thence that he
took his name of <i>Virgil</i> and <i>Parthenias</i>, which does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>not necessarily signify <i>base-born</i>. Donatus and
Servius, very good grammarians, give a quite contrary
sense of it. He seems to make allusion to
this original of his name in that passage,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Illo Virgilium me tempore dulcis alebat</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Parthenope.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And this may serve to illustrate his compliment
to C&aelig;sar, in which he invites him into his own
constellation,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where, in the void of heaven, a place is free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the Scorpion and the maid, for thee&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>thus placing him betwixt Justice and Power, and in
a neighbour mansion to his own; for Virgil supposed
souls to ascend again to their proper and
congenial stars. Being therefore of this humour, it
is no wonder that he refused the embraces of the
beautiful Plotia, when his indiscreet friend almost
threw her into his arms.</p>

<p>But however he stood affected to the ladies,
there is a dreadful accusation brought against him
for the most unnatural of all vices, which, by the
malignity of human nature, has found more credit
in latter times than it did near his own. This took
not its rise so much from the "Alexis," in which
pastoral there is not one immodest word, as from a
sort of ill-nature, that will not let any one be without
the imputation of some vice; and principally
because he was so strict a follower of Socrates and
Plato. In order, therefore, to his vindication, I
shall take the matter a little higher.</p>

<p>The Cretans were anciently much addicted to
navigation, insomuch that it became a Greek proverb,
(though omitted, I think, by the industrious
Er<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>asmus,) a <i>Cretan that does not know the sea</i>.
Their neighbourhood gave them occasion of frequent
commerce with the Ph&oelig;nicians, that accursed
people, who infected the western world with
endless superstitions, and gross immoralities. From
them it is probable that the Cretans learned this
infamous passion, to which they were so much addicted,
that Cicero remarks, in his book "<i>De Rep.</i>"
that it was "a disgrace for a young gentleman to
be without lovers." Socrates, who was a great admirer
of the Cretan constitutions, set his excellent
wit to find out some good cause and use of this
evil inclination, and therefore gives an account,
wherefore beauty is to be loved, in the following
passage; for I will not trouble the reader, weary
perhaps already, with a long Greek quotation.
"There is but one eternal, immutable, uniform
beauty; in contemplation of which, our sovereign
happiness does consist: and therefore a true lover
considers beauty and proportion as so many steps
and degrees, by which he may ascend from the particular
to the general, from all that is lovely of feature,
or regular in proportion, or charming in
sound, to the general fountain of all perfection.
And if you are so much transported with the sight
of beautiful persons, as to wish neither to eat nor
drink, but pass your whole life in their conversation;
to what ecstasy would it raise you to behold
the original beauty, not filled up with flesh and
blood, or varnished with a fading mixture of colours,
and the rest of mortal trifles and fooleries,
but separate, unmixed, uniform, and divine," &amp;c.
Thus far Socrates, in a strain much beyond the
"<i>Socrate Chr&eacute;tien</i>" of Mr Balzac: and thus that
admirable man loved his Ph&aelig;don, his Charmides,
and The&aelig;tetus; and thus Virgil loved his Alexander
and Cebes, under the feigned name of Alexis:
he received them illiterate, but returned them to
their masters, the one a good poet, and the other
an excellent grammarian. And, to prevent all possible
misinterpretations, he warily inserted, into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
the liveliest episode in the whole "&AElig;ne&iuml;s," these
words,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Nisus amore pio pueri</i>&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>and, in the sixth, "<i>Quique pii vates</i>." He seems
fond of the words, <i>castus</i>, <i>pius</i>, <i>virgo</i>, and the compounds
of it: and sometimes stretches the use of
that word further than one would think he reasonably
should have done, as when he attributes it to
Pasipha&euml; herself.</p>

<p>Another vice he is taxed with, is avarice, because
he died rich; and so indeed he did, in comparison
of modern wealth. His estate amounts to
near seventy-five thousand pounds of our money:
but Donatus does not take notice of this as a thing
extraordinary; nor was it esteemed so great a matter,
when the cash of a great part of the world lay
at Rome. Antony himself bestowed at once two
thousand acres of land, in one of the best provinces
of Italy, upon a ridiculous scribbler, who is named
by Cicero and Virgil. A late cardinal used to purchase
ill flattery at the expence of a hundred thousand
crowns a year. But, besides Virgil's other benefactors,
he was much in favour with Augustus,
whose bounty to him had no limits, but such as the
modesty of Virgil prescribed to it. Before he had
made his own fortune, he settled his estate upon
his parents and brothers; sent them yearly large
sums, so that they lived in great plenty and respect;
and, at his death, divided his estate betwixt
duty and gratitude, leaving one half to his relations,
and the other to M&aelig;cenas, to Tucca, and Varius,
and a considerable legacy to Augustus, who had introduced
a politic fashion of being in every body's
will; which alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span> was a fair revenue for a prince.
Virgil shows his detestation of this vice, by placing
in the front of the damned those who did not relieve
their relations and friends; for the Romans
hardly ever extended their liberality further; and
therefore I do not remember to have met, in all the
Latin poets, one character so noble as that short
one in Homer:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&Phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf; &delta;' &#x1F26;&nu; &alpha;&nu;&theta;&rho;&omega;&pi;&omicron;&iota;&sigma;&iota;;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&Pi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&sigmaf; &gamma;&alpha;&rho; &phi;&iota;&lambda;&epsilon;&epsilon;&sigma;&kappa;&epsilon;&nu;.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On the other hand, he gives a very advanced
place in Elysium to good patriots, &amp;c. observing, in
all his poem, that rule so sacred among the Romans,
"That there should be no art allowed, which did
not tend to the improvement of the people in virtue."
And this was the principle too of our excellent
Mr Waller, who used to say, that he would
raze any line out of his poems, which did not imply
some motive to virtue: but he was unhappy in the
choice of the subject of his admirable vein in poetry.
The Countess of Carlisle was the Helen of her country.
There is nothing in Pagan philosophy more
true, more just, and regular, than Virgil's ethics;
and it is hardly possible to sit down to the serious
perusal of his works, but a man shall rise more disposed
to virtue and goodness, as well as most agreeably
entertained; the contrary to which disposition
may happen sometimes upon the reading of
Ovid, of Martial, and several other second-rate
poets. But of the craft and tricking part of life,
with which Homer abounds, there is nothing to be
found in Virgil; and therefore Plato, who gives
the former so many good words, perfumes, crowns,
but at last complimentally banishes him his commonwealth,
would have entreated Virgil to stay
with him, (if they had lived in the same age,) and
entrusted him with some important charge in his
government. Thus was his life as chaste as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
style; and those who can critic his poetry, can never
find a blemish in his manners; and one would
rather wish to have that purity of mind, which the
satirist himself attributes to him; that friendly disposition,
and evenness of temper, and patience,
which he was master of in so eminent a degree,
than to have the honour of being author of the
"&AElig;ne&iuml;s," or even of the "Georgics" themselves.</p>

<p>Having therefore so little relish for the usual
amusements of the world, he prosecuted his studies
without any considerable interruption, during the
whole course of his life, which one may reasonably
conjecture to have been something longer than fifty-two
years; and therefore it is no wonder that he
became the most general scholar that Rome ever
bred, unless some one should except Varro. Besides
the exact knowledge of rural affairs, he understood
medicine, to which profession he was designed
by his parents. A curious florist; on which
subject one would wish he had writ, as he once intended:
so profound a naturalist, that he has solved
more phenomena of nature upon sound principles,
than Aristotle in his Physics: he studied geometry,
the most opposite of all sciences to a poetic genius,
and beauties of a lively imagination; but this promoted
the order of his narrations, his propriety of
language, and clearness of expression, for which he
was justly called the <i>pillar of the Latin tongue</i>. This
geometrical spirit was the cause, that, to fill up a
verse, he would not insert one superfluous word;
and therefore deserves that character which a noble
and judicious writer has given him, "That he never
says too little, nor too much."<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Nor could any
one ever fill up the verses he left imperfect. There
is one supplied near the beginning of the First
Book. Virgil left the verse thus,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----<i>Hic illius arma,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hic currus fuit</i>&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the rest is none of his.</p>

<p>He was so good a geographer, that he has not
only left us the finest description of Italy that ever
was, but, besides, was one of the few ancients who
knew the true system of the earth, its being inhabited
round about, under the torrid zone, and near
the poles. Metrodorus, in his five books of the
"Zones," justifies him from some exceptions made
against him by astronomers. His rhetoric was in
such general esteem, that lectures were read upon
it in the reign of Tiberius, and the subject of declamations
taken out of him. Pollio himself, and many
other ancients, commented him. His esteem degenerated
into a kind of superstition. The known
story of Mr Cowley is an instance of it<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>. But the
<i>sortes Virgilian&aelig;</i> were condemned by St Austin,
and other casuists. Abienus, by an odd design, put
all Virgil and Livy into iambic verse; and the pictures
of those two were hung in the most honourable
place of public libraries; and the design of taking
them down, and destroying Virgil's works,
was looked upon as one of the most extravagant
amongst the many brutish phrenzies of Caligula.</p>

The Life of Virgil has usually been ascribed to William Walsh,
whose merits as a minor poet are now forgotten, but who still
lives in the grateful strains of Pope, whose juvenile essays he encouraged,
as well as in the encomium of Dryden, whom he patronised
in age and adversity. I have left his name in possession
of the Essay on the Pastorals, although it also was probably written
by Dr Chetwood. See <span class="smcap">Malone</span>, Vol. III. p. 549.</p></div>

<span class="i0">And tell thy soul, she should have fled before.<br /></span>

<p>
But neither Horace nor Dryden expected to die a day the
sooner for these ardent expressions; and, in extolling the gratitude
of the ancients at the expence of the moderns, Walsh only
gives another instance of the cant which distinguishes his compositions.</p></div>

at random into the volume, and applying the line to which chance
directed the finger, as an answer to the doubt propounded. Cowley
seems to have been a firm believer in this kind of sooth-saying.
When at Paris, and secretary to Lord Jermin, he writes to Bennet
his opinion concerning the probability of concluding a treaty with
the Scottish nation; and adds, "And, to tell you the truth, which
I take to be an argument above all the rest, Virgil has told the
same thing to that purpose." There is a story, that Charles I.

the issue of the civil war, and that the former lighted upon
this ominous response:

Lord Faulkland drew an answer equally prophetic of his fate.

<p>
These follies seem to have been founded upon the vulgar idea
still current at Naples, that Virgil was a magician. Gervas of
Tilbury was an early propagator of this scandal, which was current
during the middle ages, so that Naud&aelig;us thinks it necessary
to apologize for Virgil, among other great men accused of necromancy.
These legends formed the contents of a popular romance.</p></div></div>

<h3>TO<br />

THE RIGHT HONOURABLE<br />

HUGH,<br />

LORD CLIFFORD,<br />

BARON OF CHUDLEIGH.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></h3>


<p>
MY LORD,<br />
</p>

<p>I have found it not more difficult to translate Virgil,
than to find such patrons as I desire for my
translation. For, though England is not wanting in
a learned nobility, yet such are my unhappy circumstances,
that they have confined me to a narrow
choice.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> To the greater part I have not the
honour to be known; and to some of them I cannot
show at present, by any public act, that grateful
respect which I shall ever bear them in my
heart. Yet I have no reason to complain of fortune,
since, in the midst of that abundance, I could
not possibly have chosen better, than the worthy
son of so illustrious a father. He was the patron
of my manhood, when I flourished in the opinion
of the world; though with small advantage to my
fortune, till he awakened the remembrance of my
royal master. He was that Pollio, or that Varus,<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>
who introduced me to Augustus: and, though
he soon dismissed himself from state affairs, yet, in
the short time of his administration, he shone so
powerfully upon me, that, like the heat of a Russian
summer, he ripened the fruits of poetry in a cold
climate, and gave me wherewithal to subsist, at
least, in the long winter which succeeded. What
I now offer to your lordship, is the wretched remainder
of a sickly age, worn out with study, and
oppressed by fortune; without other support than
the constancy and patience of a Christian. You,
my lord, are yet in the flower of your youth, and
may live to enjoy the benefits of the peace which
is promised Europe: I can only hear of that blessing;
for years, and, above all things, want of
health, have shut me out from sharing in the happiness.
The poets, who condemn their Tantalus to
hell, had added to his torments, if they had placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>him in Elysium, which is the proper emblem of my
condition. The fruit and the water may reach my
lips, but cannot enter; and, if they could, yet I
want a palate as well as a digestion. But it is some
kind of pleasure to me, to please those whom I respect;
and I am not altogether out of hope, that
these Pastorals of Virgil may give your lordship
some delight, though made English by one who
scarce remembers that passion which inspired my
author when he wrote them. These were his first
essay in poetry, if the "Ceiris"<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> was not his: and it
was more excusable in him to describe love when
he was young, than for me to translate him when I
am old. He died at the age of fifty-two; and I began
this work in my great climacteric. But, having
perhaps a better constitution than my author,
I have wronged him less, considering my circumstances,
than those who have attempted him before,
either in our own, or any modern language.
And, though this version is not void of errors, yet
it comforts me, that the faults of others are not
worth finding. Mine are neither gross nor frequent
in those Eclogues, wherein my master has
raised himself above that humble style in which
pastoral delights, and which, I must confess, is proper
to the education and converse of shepherds: for
he found the strength of his genius betimes, and
was, even in his youth, preluding to his "Georgics"
and his "&AElig;ne&iuml;s." He could not forbear to try his
wings, though his pinions were not hardened to
maintain a long laborious flight; yet sometimes
they bore him to a pitch as lofty as ever he was
able to reach afterwards. But, when he was admonished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>by his subject to descend, he came down
gently, circling in the air, and singing, to the
ground; like a lark, melodious in her mounting,
and continuing her song till she alights, still preparing
for a higher flight at her next sally, and tuning
her voice to better music. The fourth, the sixth,
and the eighth Pastorals, are clear evidences of this
truth. In the three first, he contains himself within
his bounds: but, addressing to Pollio, his great
patron, and himself no vulgar poet, he no longer
could restrain the freedom of his spirit, but began
to assert his native character, which is sublimity&mdash;putting
himself under the conduct of the same Cum&aelig;an
Sibyl, whom afterwards he gave for a guide to his
&AElig;neas. It is true, he was sensible of his own boldness;
and we know it by the <i>paulo majora</i>, which begins
his fourth Eclogue. He remembered, like young
Manlius, that he was forbidden to engage; but what
avails an express command to a youthful courage,
which presages victory in the attempt?<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Encouraged
with success, he proceeds farther in the sixth,
and invades the province of philosophy. And,
notwithstanding that Ph&oelig;bus had forewarned him
of singing wars, as he there confesses, yet he presumed,
that the search of nature was as free to him
as to Lucretius, who, at his age, explained it according
to the principles of Epicurus. In his eighth
Eclogue, he has innovated nothing; the former
part of it being the complaint and despair of a forsaken
lover; the latter, a charm of an enchantress,
to renew a lost affection. But the complaint perhaps
contains some topics which are above the condition
of his persons; and our author seems to have
made his herdsmen somewhat too learned for their
profession: the charms are also of the same nature;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>but both were copied from Theocritus, and had received
the applause of former ages in their original.</p>

<p>There is a kind of rusticity in all those pompous
verses; somewhat of a holiday shepherd strutting
in his country buskins. The like may be observed
both in the "Pollio" and the "Silenus," where the
similitudes are drawn from the woods and meadows.
They seem to me to represent our poet betwixt a
farmer and a courtier, when he left Mantua for
Rome, and drest himself in his best habit to appear
before his patron, somewhat too fine for the place
from whence he came, and yet retaining part of its
simplicity. In the ninth Pastoral, he collects some
beautiful passages, which were scattered in Theocritus,
which he could not insert into any of his former
Eclogues, and yet was unwilling they should be
lost. In all the rest, he is equal to his Sicilian master,
and observes, like him, a just decorum both of
the subject and the persons; as particularly in the
third Pastoral, where one of his shepherds describes
a bowl, or mazer, curiously carved:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>In medio duo signa: Conon, et quis fuit alter,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Descripsit radio, totum qui gentibus orbem?</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He remembers only the name of Conon, and forgets
the other on set purpose. Whether he means Anaximander,
or Eudoxus, I dispute not; but he was
certainly forgotten, to show his country swain was
no great scholar.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>
<p>After all, I must confess, that the boorish dialect
of Theocritus has a secret charm in it, which the
Roman language cannot imitate, though Virgil has
drawn it down as low as possibly he could; as in
the <i>cujum pecus</i>, and some other words, for which
he was so unjustly blamed by the bad critics of his
age, who could not see the beauties of that <i>merum</i>
<i>rus</i>, which the poet described in those expressions.
But Theocritus may justly be preferred as the original,
without injury to Virgil, who modestly contents
himself with the second place, and glories
only in being the first who transplanted pastoral
into his own country, and brought it there to bear
as happily as the cherry-trees which Lucullus brought
from Pontus.</p>

<p>Our own nation has produced a third poet in this
kind, not inferior to the two former: for the "Shepherd's
Kalendar" of Spenser is not to be matched in
any modern language, not even by Tasso's "Aminta,"
which infinitely transcends Guarini's "Pastor Fido,"
as having more of nature in it, and being almost
wholly clear from the wretched affectation of learning.
I will say nothing of the "Piscatory Eclogues,"
because no modern Latin can bear criticism.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> It
is no wonder, that, rolling down, through so many
barbarous ages, from the spring of Virgil, it
bears along with it the filth and ordures of the Goths
and Vandals. Neither will I mention Monsieur
Fontenelle, the living glory of the French. It is
enough for him to have excelled his master Lucian,
without attempting to compare our miserable age
with that of Virgil, or Theocritus. Let me only
add, for his reputation,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----<i>Si Pergama dextr&acirc;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Defendi possint, etiam h&acirc;c defensa fuissent.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Spenser, being master of our northern <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>dialect,
and skilled in Chaucer's English, has so exactly
imitated the Doric of Theocritus, that his love is a
perfect image of that passion which God infused
into both sexes, before it was corrupted with the
knowledge of arts, and the ceremonies of what we
call good manners.</p>

<p>My lord, I know to whom I dedicate; and could
not have been induced, by any motive, to put this
part of Virgil, or any other, into unlearned hands.
You have read him with pleasure, and, I dare say, with
admiration, in the Latin, of which you are a master.
You have added to your natural endowments,
which, without flattery, are eminent, the superstructures
of study, and the knowledge of good authors.
Courage, probity, and humanity, are inherent
in you. These virtues have ever been habitual
to the ancient house of Cumberland, from whence
you are descended, and of which our chronicles
make so honourable mention in the long wars betwixt
the rival families of York and Lancaster.
Your forefathers have asserted the party which they
chose till death, and died for its defence in the
fields of battle. You have, besides, the fresh remembrance
of your noble father, from whom you
never can degenerate:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----<i>Nec imbellem feroces</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Progenerant aquil&aelig; columbam.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>
<p>It being almost morally impossible for you to be
other than you are by kind, I need neither praise
nor incite your virtue. You are acquainted with
the Roman history, and know, without my information,
that patronage and clientship always descended
from the fathers to the sons, and that the
same plebeian houses had recourse to the same patrician
line which had formerly protected them,
and followed their principles and fortunes to the
last. So that I am your lordship's by descent, and
part of your inheritance. And the natural inclination
which I have to serve you, adds to your paternal
right; for I was wholly yours from the first moment
when I had the happiness and honour of being
known to you. Be pleased therefore to accept
the rudiments of Virgil's poetry, coarsely translated,
I confess, but which yet retain some beauties
of the author, which neither the barbarity of our
language, nor my unskilfulness, could so much
sully, but that they appear sometimes in the dim
mirror which I hold before you. The subject is
not unsuitable to your youth, which allows you yet
to love, and is proper to your present scene of life.
Rural recreations abroad, and books at home, are
the innocent pleasures of a man who is early wise,
and gives Fortune no more hold of him, than of
necessity he must. It is good, on some occasions,
to think before-hand as little as we can; to enjoy
as much of the present as will not endanger our
futurity; and to provide ourselves of the virtuoso's
saddle, which will be sure to amble, when the
world is upon the hardest trot. What I humbly
offer to your lordship, is of this nature. I wish it
pleasant, and am sure it is innocent. May you
ever continue your esteem for Virgil, and not lessen
it for the faults of his translator; who is, with all
manner of respect and sense of gratitude,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20.5em;">My Lord,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 21.5em;">Your Lordship's</span><br />

<h3>PREFACE<br />

TO THE<br />

PASTORALS,<br />

WITH<br />

A SHORT DEFENCE<br />

OF<br />

<i>VIRGIL</i>,<br />

AGAINST SOME OF THE REFLECTIONS OF<br />

MONSIEUR FONTENELLE.</h3>


<p class="center">BY WILLIAM WALSH, <span class="smcap">Esq.</span></p>

<p>As the writings of greatest antiquity are in verse,
so, of all sorts of poetry, pastorals seem the most
ancient; being formed upon the model of the first
innocence and simplicity, which the moderns, better
to dispense themselves from imitating, have
wisely thought fit to treat as fabulous, and impracticable.
And yet they, by obeying the unsophisticated
dictates of nature, enjoyed the most valuable
blessings of life; a vigorous health of body, with a
constant serenity and freedom of mind; whilst we,
with all our fanciful refinements, can scarcely pass
an autumn without some access of a fever, or a
whole day, not ruffled by some unquiet passion.
He was not then looked upon as a very old man,
who reached to a greater number of years, than in
these times an ancient family can reasonably pretend
to; and we know the names of several, who
saw and practised the world for a longer space of
time, than we can read the account of in any one
entire body of history. In short, they invented the
most useful arts, pasturage, tillage, geometry, writing,
music, astronomy, &amp;c. whilst the moderns,
like extravagant heirs made rich by their industry,
ungratefully deride the good old gentleman who left
them the estate. It is not therefore to be wondered
at, that pastorals are fallen into disesteem, together
with that fashion of life, upon which they
were grounded. And methinks I see the reader
already uneasy at this part of Virgil, counting the
pages, and posting to the "&AElig;ne&iuml;s:" so delightful an
entertainment is the very relation of public mischief
and slaughter now become to mankind. And yet
Virgil passed a much different judgment on his
own works: he valued most this part, and his
"Georgics," and depended upon them for his reputation
with posterity; but censures himself in one of
his letters to Augustus, for meddling with heroics,
the invention of a degenerating age. This is the
reason that the rules of pastoral are so little known,
or studied. Aristotle, Horace, and the Essay of
Poetry, take no notice of it; and Monsieur Boileau,
one of the most accurate of the moderns, because
he never loses the ancients out of his sight, bestows
scarce half a page on it.</p>

<p>It is the design therefore of the few followin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>g
pages, to clear this sort of writing from vulgar prejudices;
to vindicate our author from some unjust
imputations; to look into some of the rules of this
sort of poetry, and enquire what sort of versification
is most proper for it; in which point we are
so much inferior to the ancients, that this consideration
alone were enough to make some writers
think as they ought, that is meanly, of their own
performances.</p>

<p>As all sorts of poetry consist in imitation, pastoral
is the <i>imitation of a Shepherd, considered under</i>
<i>that character</i>. It is requisite therefore to be a little
informed of the condition and qualification of
these shepherds.</p>

<p>One of the ancients has observed truly, but satirically
enough, that, "Mankind is the measure of
every thing." And thus, by a gradual improvement
of this mistake, we come to make our own age and
country the rule and standard of others, and ourselves
at last the measure of them all. We figure
the ancient countrymen like our own, leading a
painful life in poverty and contempt, without wit,
or courage, or education. But men had quite different
notions of these things, for the first four
thousand years of the world. Health and strength
were then in more esteem than the refinements of
pleasure; and it was accounted a great deal more
honourable to till the ground, or keep a flock of
sheep, than to dissolve in wantonness and effeminating
sloth.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Hunting has now an idea of quality
joined to it, and is become the most important
business in the life of a gentleman; anciently it was
quite otherways.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Mr Fleury has severely remarked,
that this extravagant passion for hunting is a
strong proof of our Gothic extraction, and shews
an affinity of humour with the savage Americans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
The barbarous Franks and other Germans, (having
neither corn nor wine of their own growth,) when
they passed the Rhine, and possessed themselves of
countries better cultivated, left the tillage of the
land to the old proprietors; and afterwards continued
to hazard their lives as freely for their diversion,
as they had done before for their necessary
subsistence. The English gave this usage the sacred
stamp of fashion; and from hence it is that
most of our terms of hunting are French.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> The
reader will, I hope, give me his pardon for my freedom
on this subject, since an ill accident, occasioned
by hunting, has kept England in pain, these
several months together, for one of the best and
greatest peers<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> which she has bred for some ages;
no less illustrious for civil virtues and learning,
than his ancestors were for all their victories in
France.</p>

<p>But there are some prints still left of the ancient
esteem for husbandry, and their plain fashion of
life, in many of our surnames, and in the escutcheons
of the most ancient families, even those of
the greatest kings, the roses, the lilies, the thistle,
&amp;c. It is generally known, that one of the principal
causes of the deposing of Mahomet the Fourth,
was, that he would not allot part of the day to some
manual labour, according to the law of Mahomet,
and ancient practice of his predecessors. He that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
reflects on this, will be the less surprised to find
that Charlemagne, eight hundred years ago, ordered
his children to be instructed in some profession;
and, eight hundred years yet higher, that Augustus
wore no clothes but such as were made by the
hands of the empress and her daughters; and
Olympias did the same for Alexander the Great.
Nor will he wonder, that the Romans, in great exigency,
sent for their dictator from the plough,
whose whole estate was but of four acres; too little
a spot now for the orchard, or kitchen-garden, of
a private gentleman. It is commonly known, that
the founders of three the most renowned monarchies
in the world were shepherds; and the subject
of husbandry has been adorned by the writings and
labour of more than twenty kings. It ought not
therefore to be matter of surprise to a modern writer,
that kings, the shepherds of the people in Homer,
laid down their first rudiments in tending their
mute subjects; nor that the wealth of Ulysses consisted
in flocks and herds, the intendants over which
were then in equal esteem with officers of state in
latter times. And therefore Eum&aelig;us is called &delta;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf; &#x1F51;&phi;&omicron;&rho;&beta;&omicron;&sigmaf;
in Homer; not so much because Homer was
a lover of a country life, to which he rather seems
averse, but by reason of the dignity and greatness
of his trust, and because he was the son of a king,
stolen away, and sold by the Ph&oelig;nician pirates;
which the ingenious Mr Cowley seems not to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>taken notice of. Nor will it seem strange, that the
master of the horse to king Latinus, in the ninth
&AElig;ne&iuml;d, was found in the homely employment of
cleaving blocks, when news of the first skirmish
betwixt the Trojans and Latins was brought to him.</p>

<p>Being therefore of such quality, they cannot be
supposed so very ignorant and unpolished: the
learning and good-breeding of the world was then
in the hands of such people. He who was chosen
by the consent of all parties to arbitrate so delicate
an affair as, which was the fairest of the three celebrated
beauties of heaven&mdash;he who had the address to
debauch away Helen from her husband, her native
country, and from a crown&mdash;understood what the
French call by the too soft name of <i>galanterie</i>; he
had accomplishments enough, how ill use soever he
made of them. It seems, therefore, that M. Fontenelle
had not duly considered the matter, when
he reflected so severely upon Virgil, as if he had
not observed the laws of decency in his Pastorals,
in making shepherds speak to things beside their
character, and above their capacity. He stands
amazed, that shepherds should thunder out, as he
expresses himself, the formation of the world, and
that too according to the system of Epicurus. "In
truth," says he, page <a href="#Page_176">176</a>, "I cannot tell what to
make of this whole piece, (the sixth Pastoral.) I can
neither comprehend the design of the author, nor
the connection of the parts. First come the ideas
of philosophy, and presently after those incoherent
fables, &amp;c." To expose him yet more, he subjoins,
"It is Silenus himself who makes all this absurd
discourse. Virgil says indeed, that he had drank
too much the day before; perhaps the debauch
hung in his head when he composed this poem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>" &amp;c.
Thus far M. Fontenelle, who, to the disgrace of
reason, as himself ingenuously owns, first built his
house, and then studied architecture; I mean, first
composed his Eclogues, and then studied the rules.
In answer to this, we may observe, first, that this
very pastoral which he singles out to triumph over,
was recited by a famous player on the Roman theatre,
with marvellous applause; insomuch that Cicero,
who had heard part of it only, ordered the
whole to be rehearsed, and, struck with admiration
of it, conferred then upon Virgil the glorious title of</p>

<p class="center"><i>Magn&aelig; spes altera Rom&aelig;.</i>
</p>

<p>Nor is it old Donatus only who relates this; we
have the same account from another very credible
and ancient author; so that here we have the
judgment of Cicero, and the people of Rome, to
confront the single opinion of this adventurous critic.
A man ought to be well assured of his own
abilities, before he attacks an author of established
reputation. If Mr Fontenelle had perused the fragments
of the Ph&oelig;nician antiquity, traced the progress
of learning through the ancient Greek writers,
or so much as consulted his learned countryman
Huetius, he would have found, (which falls out
unluckily for him,) that a Chald&aelig;an shepherd discovered
to the Egyptians and Greeks the creation
of the world. And what subject more fit for such a
pastoral, than that great affair which was first notified
to the world by one of that profession? Nor
does it appear, (what he takes for granted,) that Virgil
describes the original of the world according to
the hypothesis of Epicurus. He was too well seen
in antiquity to commit such a gross mistake; there
is not the least mention of <i>chance</i> in that w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>hole
passage, nor of the <i>clinamen principiorum</i>, so peculiar
to Epicurus's hypothesis. Virgil had not only
more piety, but was of too nice a judgment to introduce
a god denying the power and providence of
the Deity, and singing a hymn to the atoms and
blind chance. On the contrary, his description
agrees very well with that of Moses; and the eloquent
commentator Dacier, who is so confident
that Horace had perused the sacred history, might
with greater reason have affirmed the same thing of
Virgil; for, besides that famous passage in the sixth
&AElig;ne&iuml;d, (by which this may be illustrated,) where the
word <i>principio</i> is used in the front of both by Moses
and Virgil, and the seas are first mentioned, and
the <i>spiritus intus alit</i>, which might not improbably,
as M. Dacier would suggest, allude to the "<i>Spirit</i>
<i>moving upon the face of the waters</i>;" but, omitting
this parallel place, the successive formation of the
world is evidently described in these words,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Rerum paulatim sumere formas</i>:
</p>

<p>And it is hardly possible to render more literally
that verse of Moses, "<i>Let the waters be gathered</i>
<i>into one place, and let the dry land appear</i>," than in
this of Virgil,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Jam durare solum, et discludere Nerea ponto.</i>
</p>

<p>After this, the formation of the sun is described,
(exactly in the Mosaical order,) and, next, the production
of the first living creatures, and that too in
a small number, (still in the same method,)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Rara per ignotos errent animalia montes.</i>
</p>

<p>And here the foresaid author would probably remark,
that Virgil keeps more exactly to the Mosaic
system, than an ingenious writer, who will by no
means allow mountains to be coeval with the world.
Thus much will make it probable at least, that Virgil
had Moses in his thoughts rather than Epicurus,
when he composed this poem. But it is further
remarkable, that this passage was taken from a song
attributed to Apollo, who himself, too, unluckily
had been a shepherd; and he took it from another
yet more ancient, composed by the first inventor
of music, and at that time a shepherd too; and this
is one of the noblest fragments of Greek antiquity.
And, because I cannot suppose the ingenious M.
Fontenelle one of their number, who pretend to
censure the Greeks, without being able to distinguish
Greek from Ephesian characters, I shall
here set down the lines from which Virgil took this
passage, though none of the commentators have
observed it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&tau;&eta; &delta;' &#x1F41;&iota; &#x1F11;&sigma;&pi;&epsilon;&tau;&omicron; &phi;&omega;&nu;&eta;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&Kappa;&rho;&alpha;&iota;&nu;&omega;&nu; &alpha;&theta;&alpha;&nu;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf; &tau;&epsilon; &theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;, &kappa;&alpha;&iota; &gamma;&alpha;&iota;&alpha;&nu; &epsilon;&rho;&epsilon;&mu;&nu;&eta;&nu;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#x1F69;&sigmaf; &tau;&alpha; &pi;&rho;&omega;&tau;&alpha; &gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&nu;&tau;&omicron;, &kappa;&alpha;&iota; &#x1F61;&sigmaf; &lambda;&alpha;&chi;&epsilon; &mu;&omicron;&iota;&rho;&alpha;&nu; &#x1F11;&kappa;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus Linus too began his poem, as appears by a
fragment of it preserved by Diogenes Laertius; and
the like may be instanced in Mus&aelig;us himself; so
that our poet here, with great judgment, as always,
follows the ancient custom of beginning their more
solemn songs with the creation, and does it too
most properly under the person of a shepherd.
And thus the first and best employment of poetry
was, to compose hymns in honour of the great Creator
of the universe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>
<p>Few words will suffice to answer his other objections.
He demands why those several transformations
are mentioned in that poem:&mdash;And is not fable
then the life and soul of poetry? Can himself
assign a more proper subject of pastoral than the
<i>Saturnia regna</i>, the age and scene of this kind of
poetry? What theme more fit for the song of a god,
or to imprint religious awe, than the omnipotent
power of transforming the species of creatures at
their pleasure? Their families lived in groves, near
the clear springs; and what better warning could be
given to the hopeful young shepherds, than that
they should not gaze too much into the liquid dangerous
looking-glass, for fear of being stolen by the
water-nymphs, that is, falling and being drowned,
as Hylas was? Pasipha&euml;'s monstrous passion for a
bull is certainly a subject enough fitted for bucolics.
Can M. Fontenelle tax Silenus for fetching too far
the transformation of the sisters of Pha&euml;ton into
trees, when perhaps they sat at that very time under
the hospitable shade of those alders and poplars&mdash;or
the metamorphosis of Philomela into that ravishing
bird, which makes the sweetest music of the
groves? If he had looked into the ancient Greek
writers, or so much as consulted honest Servius,
he would have discovered, that, under the allegory
of this drunkenness of Silenus, the refinement and
exaltation of men's minds by philosophy was intended.
But, if the author of these reflections
can take such flights in his wine, it is almost pity
that drunkenness should be a sin, or that he should
ever want good store of burgundy and champaign.
But indeed he seems not to have ever drank out of
Silenus's tankard, when he composed either his
Critique or Pastorals.</p>

<p>His censure on the fourth seems worse grounded
than the other. It is entitled, in some ancient manuscripts,
the "History of the Renovation of the
World." He complains, that he "cannot understand
what is meant by those many figurative expressions:"
but, if he had consulted the younger Vossius's
dissertation on this Pastoral, or read the excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
oration of the emperor Constantine, made
French by a good pen of their own, he would have
found there the plain interpretation of all those figurative
expressions; and, withal, very strong proofs
of the truth of the Christian religion; such as converted
heathens, as Valerianus, and others. And,
upon account of this piece, the most learned of all
the Latin fathers calls Virgil a Christian, even before
Christianity. Cicero takes notice of it in his
books of Divination; and Virgil probably had put
it in verse a considerable time before the edition
of his Pastorals. Nor does he appropriate it to
Pollio, or his son, but complimentally dates it from
his consulship; and therefore some one, who had
not so kind thoughts of M. Fontenelle as I, would
be inclined to think him as bad a Catholic as critic
in this place.</p>

<p>But, in respect to some books he has wrote
since, I pass by a great part of this, and shall
only touch briefly some of the rules of this sort
of poem.</p>

<p>The first is, that an air of piety, upon all occasions,
should be maintained in the whole poem.
This appears in all the ancient Greek writers, as
Homer, Hesiod, Aratus, &amp;c. And Virgil is so exact
in the observation of it, not only in this work,
but in his "&AElig;ne&iuml;s" too, that a celebrated French
writer taxes him for permitting &AElig;neas to do nothing
without the assistance of some god. But by
this it appears, at least, that M. St Evremont is no
Jansenist.</p>

<p>M. Fontenelle seems a little defective in this
point: he brings in a pair of shepherdesses disputing
very warmly, whether <i>Victoria</i> be a go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>ddess or
a woman. Her great condescension and compassion,
her affability and goodness, (none of the
meanest attributes of the divinity,) pass for convincing
arguments, that she could not possibly be a
goddess.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Les D&eacute;esses, to&ucirc;jours fi&egrave;res et m&eacute;prisantes,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ne rassureroient point les berg&egrave;res tremblantes</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Par d'obligeans discours, des souris gracieux.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Mais tu l'as vu: cette auguste personne,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Qui vient de paro&icirc;tre en ces lieux,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Prend soin de rassurer au moment qu'elle &eacute;tonne;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sa bont&eacute; descendant sans peine jusqu' &agrave; nous.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In short, she has too many divine perfections to be
a deity, and therefore she is a mortal; which was
the thing to be proved. It is directly contrary to
the practice of all ancient poets, as well as to the
rules of decency and religion, to make such odious
preferences. I am much surprised, therefore, that
he should use such an argument as this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Cloris, as-tu vu des d&eacute;esses</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Avoir un air si facile et si doux?</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Was not Aurora, and Venus, and Luna, and I know
not how many more of the heathen deities, too easy
of access to Tithonus, to Anchises, and to Endymion?
Is there any thing more sparkish and better-humoured
than Venus's accosting her son in the
deserts of Libya? or than the behaviour of Pallas
to Diomedes, one of the most perfect and admirable
pieces of all the Iliads; where she condescends
to <i>ra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>ill&eacute;</i> him so agreeably; and, notwithstanding her
severe virtue, and all the ensigns of majesty with
which she so terribly adorns herself, condescends to
ride with him in his chariot? But the Odysseys
are full of greater instances of condescension than
this.</p>

<p>This brings to mind that famous passage of Lucan,
in which he prefers Cato to all the gods at once:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Victrix causa diis placuit, sed victa Catoni</i>&mdash;
</p>

<p>which Breb&oelig;uf has rendered so flatly, and which
may be thus paraphrased:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Heaven meanly with the conqueror did comply;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Cato, rather than submit, would die.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is an unpardonable presumption in any sort of
religion, to compliment their princes at the expence
of their deities.</p>

<p>But, letting that pass, this whole Eclogue is but a
long paraphrase of a trite verse in Virgil, and Homer;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Nec vox hominem sonat: O Dea certe!</i>
</p>

<p>So true is that remark of the admirable Earl of
Roscommon, if applied to the Romans, rather, I
fear, than to the English, since his own death:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----one sterling line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawn to French wire, would through whole pages shine.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another rule is, that the characters should represent
that ancient innocence, and unpractised plainness,
which was then in the world. P. Rapin has
ga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>thered many instances of this out of Theocritus
and Virgil; and the reader can do it as well as himself.
But M. Fontenelle transgressed this rule,
when he hid himself in the thicket to listen to the
private discourse of the two shepherdesses. This
is not only ill breeding at Versailles; the Arcadian
shepherdesses themselves would have set their dogs
upon one for such an unpardonable piece of rudeness.</p>

<p>A third rule is, that there should be some <i>ordonnance</i>,
some design, or little plot, which may deserve
the title of a pastoral scene. This is everywhere
observed by Virgil, and particularly remarkable
in the first Eclogue, the standard of all pastorals.
A beautiful landscape presents itself to your
view; a shepherd, with his flock around him, resting
securely under a spreading beech, which furnished
the first food to our ancestors; another in a quite
different situation of mind and circumstances; the
sun setting; the hospitality of the more fortunate
shepherd, &amp;c. And here M. Fontenelle seems not
a little wanting.</p>

<p>A fourth rule, and of great importance in this delicate
sort of writing, is, that there be choice diversity
of subjects; that the Eclogue, like a beautiful
prospect, should charm by its variety. Virgil is admirable
in this point, and far surpasses Theocritus,
as he does everywhere, when judgment and contrivance
have the principal part. The subject of
the first Pastoral is hinted above.</p>

<p>The Second contains the love of Corydon for
Alexis, and the seasonable reproach he gives himself,
that he left his vines half pruned, (which, according
to the Roman rituals, derived a curse upon
the fruit that grew upon it,) whilst he pursued an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>object undeserving his passion.</p>

<p>The Third, a sharp contention of two shepherds
for the prize of poetry.</p>

<p>The Fourth contains the discourse of a shepherd
comforting himself, in a declining age, that a better
was ensuing.</p>

<p>The Fifth, a lamentation for a dead friend, the
first draught of which is probably more ancient than
any of the pastorals now extant; his brother being
at first intended; but he afterwards makes his court
to Augustus, by turning it into an apotheosis of Julius
C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>The Sixth is the Silenus.</p>

<p>The Seventh, another poetical dispute, first composed
at Mantua.</p>

<p>The Eighth is the description of a despairing lover,
and a magical charm.</p>

<p>He sets the Ninth after all these, very modestly,
because it was particular to himself; and here
he would have ended that work, if Gallus had
not prevailed upon him to add one more in his
favour.</p>

<p>Thus curious was Virgil in diversifying his subjects.
But M. Fontenelle is a great deal too uniform:
begin where you please, the subject is still
the same. We find it true what he says of himself,</p>

<p class="center"><i>To&ucirc;jours, to&ucirc;jours de l'amour.</i>
</p>

<p>He seems to take pastorals and love-verses for
the same thing. Has human nature no other passion?
Does not fea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>r, ambition, avarice, pride, a capriccio
of honour, and laziness itself, often triumph
over love? But this passion does all, not only in
pastorals, but in modern tragedies too. A hero can
no more fight, or be sick, or die, than he can be
born, without a woman. But dramatics have been
composed in compliance to the humour of the age,
and the prevailing inclination of the great, whose
example has a more powerful influence, not only in
the little court behind the scenes, but on the great
theatre of the world. However, this inundation of
love-verses is not so much an effect of their amorousness,
as of immoderate self-love; this being
the only sort of poetry, in which the writer can, not
only without censure, but even with commendation,
talk of himself. There is generally more of the
passion of Narcissus, than concern for Chloris and
Corinna, in this whole affair. Be pleased to look
into almost any of those writers, and you shall meet
everywhere that eternal <i>Moi</i>, which the admirable
Pascal so judiciously condemns. Homer can never
be enough admired for this one so particular quality,
that he never speaks of himself, either in the
Iliad or the Odysseys: and, if Horace had never
told us his genealogy, but left it to the writer of his
life, perhaps he had not been a loser by it. This
consideration might induce those great critics, Varius
and Tucca, to raze out the four first verses of
the "&AElig;ne&iuml;s," in great measure, for the sake of that
unlucky <i>Ille ego</i>. But extraordinary geniuses have
a sort of prerogative, which may dispense them
from laws, binding to subject wits. However, the
ladies have the less reason to be pleased with
those addresses, of which the poet takes the greater
share to himself. Thus the beau presses into
their dressing-room; but it is not so much to
adore their fair eyes, as to adjust his own steenkirk
and peruke, and set his countenance in their
glass.</p>

<p>A fifth rule (which one may hope will not be
contested) is, that the writer should show in his
compositions some competent skill of the subject
matter, that which makes the character of persons
introduced. In this, as in all other points of learning,
decency, and &oelig;conomy of a poem, Virgil much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
excels his master Theocritus. The poet is better
skilled in husbandry than those that get their bread
by it. He describes the nature, the diseases, the
remedies, the proper places, and seasons, of feeding,
of watering their flocks; the furniture, diet,
the lodging and pastimes, of his shepherds. But the
persons brought in by M. Fontenelle are shepherds
in masquerade, and handle their sheep-hook as aukwardly
as they do their oaten reed. They saunter
about with their <i>chers moutons</i>; but they relate as
little to the business in hand, as the painter's dog,
or a Dutch ship, does to the history designed. One
would suspect some of them, that, instead of leading
out their sheep into the plains of Mont-Brison
and Marcilli, to the flowery banks of Lignon, or the
Charante, they are driving directly <i>&agrave; la boucherie</i>,
to make money of them. I hope hereafter M.
Fontenelle will chuse his servants better.</p>

<p>A sixth rule is, that, as the style ought to be natural,
clear, and elegant, it should have some peculiar
relish of the ancient fashion of writing. Parables
in those times were frequently used, as they
are still by the eastern nations; philosophical questions,
&aelig;nigmas, &amp;c.; and of this we find instances in
the sacred writings, in Homer, contemporary with
king David, in Herodotus, in the Greek tragedians.
This piece of antiquity is imitated by Virgil with
great judgment and discretion. He has proposed
one riddle, which has never yet been solved by any
of his commentators. Though he knew the rules
of rhetoric as well as Cicero himself, he conceals
that skill in his Pastorals, and keeps close to the
character of antiquity. Nor ought the connections
and transitions to be very strict and regular; this
would give the Pastorals an air of novelty; and of
this neglect of exact connections, we have instan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>ces
in the writings of the ancient Chineses, of the Jews
and Greeks, in Pindar, and other writers of dithyrambics,
in the choruses of &AElig;schylus, Sophocles,
and Euripides. If M. Fontenelle and Ru&aelig;us had
considered this, the one would have spared his
critique of the sixth, and the other, his reflections
upon the ninth Pastoral. The over-scrupulous care of
connections makes the modern compositions oftentimes
tedious and flat: and by the omission of them
it comes to pass, that the <i>Pens&eacute;es</i> of the incomparable
M. Pascal, and perhaps of M. Bruy&egrave;re, are two
of the most entertaining books which the modern
French can boast of. Virgil, in this point, was not
only faithful to the character of antiquity, but copies
after Nature herself. Thus a meadow, where
the beauties of the spring are profusely blended together,
makes a more delightful prospect, than a curious
<i>parterre</i> of sorted flowers in our gardens:
and we are much more transported with the beauty
of the heavens, and admiration of their Creator, in
a clear night, when we behold stars of all magnitudes
promiscuously moving together, than if those
glorious lights were ranked in their several orders,
or reduced into the finest geometrical figures.</p>

<p>Another rule omitted by P. Rapin, as some of his
are by me, (for I do not design an entire treatise in
this preface,) is, that not only the sentences should
be short and smart, (upon which account he justly
blames the Italian and French, as too talkative,)
but that the whole piece should be so too. Virgil
transgressed this rule in his first Pastorals, (I mean
those which he composed at Mantua,) but rectified
the fault in his riper years. This appears by the
<i>Culex</i>, which is as long as five of his Pastorals put
together. The greater part of those he finished
have less than a hundred verses; and but two of
them exceed that number. But the "Silenus," w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>hich
he seems to have designed for his master-piece, in
which he introduces a god singing, and he, too, full
of inspiration, (which is intended by that ebriety,
which M. Fontenelle so unreasonably ridicules,)
though it go through so vast a field of matter, and
comprises the mythology of near two thousand
years, consists but of fifty lines; so that its brevity
is no less admirable, than the subject matter, the
noble fashion of handling it, and the deity speaking.
Virgil keeps up his characters in this respect too,
with the strictest decency: for poetry and pastime
was not the business of men's lives in those days,
but only their seasonable recreation after necessary
labours. And therefore the length of some of the
modern Italian and English compositions is against
the rules of this kind of poesy.</p>

<p>I shall add something very briefly, touching the
versification of Pastorals, though it be a mortifying
consideration to the moderns. Heroic verse, as it
is commonly called, was used by the Greeks in this
sort of poem, as very ancient and natural; lyrics,
iambics, &amp;c. being invented afterwards: but there
is so great a difference in the numbers of which it
may be compounded, that it may pass rather for a
genus, than species, of verse. Whosoever shall
compare the numbers of the three following verses,
will quickly be sensible of the truth of this observation:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tityre, tu patul&aelig; recubans sub tegmine fagi</i>&mdash;
</p>

<p>the first of the Georgics,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Quid faciat l&aelig;tas segetes, quo sidere terram</i>&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
</p>

<p>and of the &AElig;ne&iuml;s,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Arma, virumque cano, Troj&aelig; qui primus ab oris.</i>
</p>

<p>The sound of the verses is almost as different as
the subjects. But the Greek writers of Pastoral
usually limited themselves to the example of the
first; which Virgil found so exceedingly difficult,
that he quitted it, and left the honour of that part
to Theocritus. It is indeed probable, that what we
improperly call rhyme, is the most ancient sort of
poetry; and learned men have given good arguments
for it; and therefore a French historian commits
a gross mistake, when he attributes that invention
to a king of Gaul, as an English gentleman
does, when he makes a Roman emperor the inventor
of it. But the Greeks, who understood fully
the force and power of numbers, soon grew weary
of this childish sort of verse, as the younger Vossius
justly calls it, and therefore those rhyming hexameters,
which Plutarch observes in Homer himself,
seem to be the remains of a barbarous age. Virgil
had them in such abhorrence, that he would rather
make a false syntax, than what we call a rhyme.
Such a verse as this,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Vir, precor</i>, uxori, <i>frater succurre</i> sorori,
</p>

<p>was passable in Ovid; but the nicer ears in Augustus's
court could not pardon Virgil for</p>

<p class="center"><i>At regina pyr&acirc;....</i>
</p>

<p>so that the principal ornament of modern poetry was
accounted deformity by the Latins and Greeks. It
was they who invented the different termination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>s of
words, those happy compositions, those short monosyllables,
those transpositions for the elegance of
the sound and sense, which are wanting so much
in modern languages. The French sometimes crowd
together ten or twelve monosyllables into one disjointed
verse. They may understand the nature of,
but cannot imitate, those wonderful spondees of
Pythagoras, by which he could suddenly pacify a
man that was in a violent transport of anger; nor
those swift numbers of the priests of Cybele, which
had the force to enrage the most sedate and
phlegmatic tempers. Nor can any modern put into
his own language the energy of that single poem of
Catullus,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Super alta vectus Atys</i>, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>Latin is but a corrupt dialect of Greek; and the
French, Spanish, and Italian, a corruption of Latin;
and therefore a man might as well go about to persuade
me that vinegar is a nobler liquor than wine,
as that the modern compositions can be as graceful
and harmonious as the Latin itself. The Greek
tongue very naturally falls into iambics, and therefore
the diligent reader may find six or seven-and-twenty
of them in those accurate orations of Isocrates.
The Latin as naturally falls into heroic;
and therefore the beginning of Livy's History is half
a hexameter, and that of Tacitus an entire one.
The Roman historian<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>, describing the glorious effort
of a colonel to break through a brigade of the
enemy's, just after the defeat at Cann&aelig;, falls, unknowingly,
into a verse not unworthy Virgil himself&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>H&aelig;c ubi dicta dedit, stringit gladium, cuneoque</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Facto, per medios....</i> &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ours and the French can at best but fall into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
blank verse, which is a fault in prose. The misfortune
indeed is common to us both; but we deserve
more compassion, because we are not vain of
our barbarities. As age brings men back into the
state and infirmities of childhood, upon the fall of
their empire, the Romans doted into rhyme, as appears
sufficiently by the hymns of the Latin church;
and yet a great deal of the French poetry does
hardly deserve that poor title. I shall give an instance
out of a poem which had the good luck to
gain the prize in 1685; for the subject deserved a
nobler pen:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Tous les jours ce grand roy, des autres roys l' exemple,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>S'ouvre un nouveau chemin au fa&icirc;te de ton temple</i>, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The judicious Malherbe exploded this sort of
verse near eighty years ago. Nor can I forbear
wondering at that passage of a famous academician,
in which he, most compassionately, excuses the ancients
for their not being so exact in their compositions
as the modern French, because they wanted
a dictionary, of which the French are at last happily
provided. If Demosthenes and Cicero had been
so lucky as to have had a dictionary, and such a
patron as cardinal Richelieu, perhaps they might
have aspired to the honour of Balzac's legacy of
ten pounds, <i>Le prix de l'&eacute;loquence</i>.</p>

<p>On the contrary, I dare assert, that there are
hardly ten lines in either of those great orators, or
even in the catalogue of Homer's ships, which are
not more harmonious, more truly rhythmical, than
most of the French or English sonnets; and therefore
they lose, at least, one half of their native
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>beauty by translation.</p>

<p>I cannot but add one remark on this occasion,&mdash;that
the French verse is oftentimes not so much as
rhyme, in the lowest sense; for the childish repetition
of the same note cannot be called music. Such
instances are infinite, as in the forecited poem:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&eacute;pris    troph&eacute;e    cach&eacute;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">m&eacute;pris   Orph&eacute;e     cherch&eacute;.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>M. Boileau himself has a great deal of this
&#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#964;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#945;, not by his own neglect, but purely by
the faultiness and poverty of the French tongue.
M. Fontenelle at last goes into the excessive paradoxes
of M. Perrault, and boasts of the vast number
of their excellent songs, preferring them to the Greek
and Latin. But an ancient writer, of as good credit,
has assured us, that seven lives would hardly suffice
to read over the Greek odes; but a few weeks
would be sufficient, if a man were so very idle as to
read over all the French. In the mean time, I
should be very glad to see a catalogue of but fifty
of theirs with</p>

<p class="center">Exact propriety of word and thought.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the high encomiums and mutual
gratulations which they give one another,
(for I am far from censuring the whole of that illustrious
society, to which the learned world is
much obliged,) after all those golden dreams at the
Louvre, that their pieces will be as much valued,
ten or twelve ages hence, as the ancient Greek or
Roman, I can no more get it into my head that
they will last so long, than I could believe the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
learned Dr H&mdash;&mdash;k [of the Royal Society,] if he
should pretend to show me a butterfly, that had
lived a thousand winters.</p>

<p>When M. Fontenelle wrote his Eclogues, he was
so far from equalling Virgil, or Theocritus, that he
had some pains to take before he could understand
in what the principal beauty and graces of their
writings do consist.</p>

<i>M&aelig;cenas's intercession; and, as an instance of his gratitude,</i>
<i>composed the following Pastoral, where he sets out his own good</i>

<h3>PASTORAL II.<br />

OR,<br />

<i>ALEXIS</i>.</h3>


<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>The commentators can by no means agree on the person of Alexis,</i>
<i>but are all of opinion that some beautiful youth is meant by him, to</i>
<i>whom Virgil here makes love, in Corydon's language and simplicity.</i>
<i>His way of courtship is wholly pastoral: he complains of the boy's</i>
<i>coyness; recommends himself for his beauty and skill in piping;</i>
<i>invites the youth into the country, where he promises him the diversions</i>
<i>of the place, with a suitable present of nuts and apples. But</i>
<i>when he finds nothing will prevail, he resolves to quit his troublesome</i>
<i>amour, and betake himself again to his former business.</i></p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Young Corydon, the unhappy shepherd swain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fair Alexis loved, but loved in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And underneath the beechen shade, alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus to the woods and mountains made his moan:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is this, unkind Alexis, my reward?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And must I die unpitied, and unheard?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the green lizard in the grove is laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sheep enjoy the coolness of the shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Thestylis wild thyme and garlic beats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For harvest hinds, o'erspent with toil and heats;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While in the scorching sun I trace in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy flying footsteps o'er the burning plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The creaking locusts with my voice conspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They fried with heat, and I with fierce desire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How much more easy was it to sustain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud Amaryllis, and her haughty reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scorns of young Menalcas, once my care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though he was black, and thou art heavenly fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trust not too much to that enchanting face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauty's a charm, but soon the charm will pass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White lilies lie neglected on the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While dusky hyacinths for use remain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My passion is thy scorn; nor wilt thou know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What wealth I have, what gifts I can bestow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What stores my dairies and my folds contain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand lambs, that wander on the plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New milk, that all the winter never fails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the summer overflows the pails.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amphion sung not sweeter to his herd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When summoned stones the Theban turrets reared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor am I so deformed; for late I stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the margin of the briny flood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds were still; and, if the glass be true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Daphnis I may vie, though judged by you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O leave the noisy town! O come and see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our country cots, and live content with me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wound the flying deer, and from their cotes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With me to drive a-field the browzing goats;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pipe and sing, and, in our country strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To copy, or perhaps contend with Pan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pan taught to join with wax unequal reeds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pan loves the shepherds, and their flocks he feeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor scorn the pipe: Amyntas, to be taught,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With all his kisses would my skill have bought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of seven smooth joints a mellow pipe I have,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which with his dying breath Dam&oelig;tas gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said,&mdash;"This, Corydon, I leave to thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For only thou deserv'st it after me."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes Amyntas durst not upward lift;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For much he grudged the praise, but more the gift.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, two kids, that in the valley strayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I found by chance, and to my fold conveyed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They drain two bagging udders every day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these shall be companions of thy play;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both fleck'd with white, the true Arcadian strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Thestylis had often begged in vain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she shall have them, if again she sues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since you the giver and the gift refuse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come to my longing arms, my lovely care!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And take the presents which the nymphs prepare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White lilies in full canisters they bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the glories of the purple spring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The daughters of the flood have searched the mead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For violets pale, and cropp'd the poppy's head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The short narcissus<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> and fair daffodil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pancies to please the sight, and cassia sweet to smell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And set soft hyacinths with iron blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shade marsh marigolds of shining hue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some bound in order, others loosely strowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dress thy bower, and trim thy new abode.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myself will search our planted grounds at home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For downy peaches and the glossy plum;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrash the chesnuts in the neighbouring grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as my Amaryllis used to love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The laurel and the myrtle sweets agree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And both in nosegays shall be bound for thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, Corydon! ah, poor unhappy swain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alexis will thy homely gifts disdain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor, should'st thou offer all thy little store,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Will rich Iolas yield, but offer more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What have I done, to name that wealthy swain?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So powerful are his presents, mine so mean!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boar, amidst my crystal streams, I bring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And southern winds to blast my flowery spring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, cruel creature! whom dost thou despise?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods, to live in woods, have left the skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And godlike Paris, in the Id&aelig;an grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Priam's wealth preferred &OElig;none's love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In cities, which she built, let Pallas reign;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towers are for gods, but forests for the swain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The greedy lioness the wolf pursues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wolf the kid, the wanton kid the browze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alexis, thou art chased by Corydon:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All follow several games, and each his own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See, from afar, the fields no longer smoke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sweating steers, unharnessed from the yoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring, as in triumph, back the crooked plough;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shadows lengthen as the sun goes low;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cool breezes now the raging heats remove:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, cruel heaven, that made no cure for love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wish for balmy sleep, but wish in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love has no bounds in pleasure, or in pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What frenzy, shepherd, has thy soul possessed?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy vineyard lies half pruned, and half undressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quench, Corydon, thy long unanswered fire!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mind what the common wants of life require;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On willow twigs employ thy weaving care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And find an easier love, though not so fair.<br /></span>

<p><a name="Footnote_298_298" id="Footnote_298_298"></a><a href="#FNanchor_298_298"><span class="label">[298]</span></a> In Latin thus,
</p>
<p>
<i>Incipe, parve puer, risu cognoscere matrem</i>, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
I have translated the passage to this sense&mdash;that the infant,
smiling on his mother, singles her out from the rest of the company
about him. Erythr&aelig;us, Bembus, and Joseph Scaliger, are
of this opinion. Yet they and I may be mistaken; for, immediately
after, we find these words, <i>cui non risere parentes</i>, which imply
another sense, as if the parents smiled on the new-born infant;
and that the babe on whom they vouchsafed not to smile, was
born to ill fortune: for they tell a story, that, when Vulcan, the
only son of Jupiter and Juno, came into the world, he was so hard-favoured,
that both his parents frowned on him, and Jupiter threw
him out of heaven: he fell on the island Lemnos, and was lame
ever afterwards. The last line of the Pastoral seems to justify
this sense:
</p>
<p>
<i>Nec Deus hunc mens&acirc;, Dea nec dignata cubili est.</i>
</p>
<p>
For, though he married Venus, yet his mother Juno was not present
at the nuptials to bless them; as appears by his wife's incontinence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>They say also, that he was banished from the banquets
of the gods. If so, that punishment could be of no long continuance;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>for Homer makes him present at their feasts, and composing
a quarrel betwixt his parents, with a bowl of nectar. The
matter is of no great consequence; and therefore I adhere to my
translation, for these two reasons: first, Virgil has his following
line,
</p>
<p>
<i>Matri longa decem tulerunt fastidia menses</i>,
</p>
<p>
as if the infant's smiling on his mother was a reward to her for
bearing him ten months in her body, four weeks longer than the
usual time. Secondly, Catullus is cited by Joseph Scaliger, as favouring
this opinion, in his Epithalamium of Manlius Torquatus:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Torquatus, volo, parvolus,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Matris e gremio su&aelig;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Porrigens teneras manus,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dulce rideat ad patrem</i>, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
What if I should steer betwixt the two extremes, and conclude,
that the infant, who was to be happy, must not only smile on his
parents, but also they on him? For Scaliger notes, that the infants
who smiled not at their birth, were observed to be &#945;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#953;, or
sullen, (as I have translated it,) during all their life; and Servius,
and almost all the modern commentators, affirm, that no child was
thought fortunate, on whom his parents smiled not at his birth. I
observe, farther, that the ancients thought the infant, who came
into the world at the end of the tenth month, was born to some
extraordinary fortune, good or bad. Such was the birth of the
late prince of Cond&eacute;'s father, of whom his mother was not brought
to bed, till almost eleven months were expired after his father's
death; yet the college of physicians at Paris concluded he was
lawfully begotten. My ingenious friend, Anthony Henley, Esq.
desired me to make a note on this passage of Virgil; adding, (what
I had not read,) that the Jews have been so superstitious, as to observe
not only the first look or action of an infant, but also the
first word which the parent, or any of the assistants, spoke after the
birth; and from thence they gave a name to the child, alluding
to it.</p></div></div>

<p><i>Two young shepherds, Chromis and Mnasylus, having been often promised</i>
<i>a song by Silenus, chance to catch him asleep in this Pastoral;</i>
<i>where they bind him hand and foot, and then claim his promise.</i>
<i>Silenus, finding they would be put off no longer, begins his song, in</i>
<i>which he describes the formation of the universe, and the original of</i>
<i>animals, according to the Epicurean philosophy; and then runs</i>
<i>through the most surprising transformations which have happened</i>
<i>in Nature since her birth. This Pastoral was designed as a compliment</i>
<i>to Syron the Epicurean, who instructed Virgil and Varus in</i>
<i>the principles of that philosophy. Silenus acts as tutor, Chromis and</i>

<span class="i0">Proceed, my Muse!&mdash;Two Satyrs, on the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched at his ease, their sire Silenus found.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dozed with his fumes, and heavy with his load,           <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">They found him snoring in his dark abode,                <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">And seized with youthful arms the drunken god.           <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">His rosy wreath was dropt not long before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Borne by the tide of wine, and floating on the floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His empty can, with ears half worn away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was hung on high, to boast the triumph of the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invaded thus, for want of better bands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His garland they unstring, and bind his hands;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His brows with berries, and his temples, dyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He finds the fraud, and, with a smile, demands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On what design the boys had bound his hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Loose me," he cried, "'twas impudence to find<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He raised his voice; and soon a numerous throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of tripping Satyrs crowded to the song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sylvan Fauns, and savage beasts, advanced;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nodding forests to the numbers danced.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not by H&aelig;monian hills the Thracian bard,            <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor awful Ph&oelig;bus was on Pindus heard             <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">With deeper silence, or with more regard.           <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">He sung the secret seeds of Nature's frame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How seas, and earth, and air, and active flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell through the mighty void, and, in their fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were blindly gathered in this goodly ball.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tender soil then, stiffening by degrees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shut from the bounded earth the bounding seas.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then earth and ocean various forms disclose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a new sun to the new world arose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mists, condensed to clouds, obscure the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clouds, dissolved, the thirsty ground supply.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rising trees the lofty mountains grace;               <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>

<span class="i0">From thence the birth of man the song pursued,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The reign of Saturn, and the golden age;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prometheus' theft, and Jove's avenging rage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cries of Argonauts for Hylas drowned,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What fury, wretched woman, seized thy breast?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maids of Argos, (though, with rage possessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their imitated lowings filled the grove,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet shunned the guilt of thy preposterous love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor sought the youthful husband of the herd,                        <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Though labouring yokes on their own necks they feared,              <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>

<h3>PASTORAL X.<br />

OR,<br />

<i>GALLUS</i>.</h3>


<p class="center">ARGUMENT.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>Gallus, a great patron of Virgil, and an excellent poet, was very</i>
<i>deeply in love with one Cytheris, whom he calls Lycoris, and who</i>
<i>had forsaken him for the company of a soldier. The poet therefore</i>
<i>supposes his friend Gallus retired, in his height of melancholy,</i>
<i>into the solitudes of Arcadia, (the celebrated scene of pastorals,)</i>
<i>where he represents him in a very languishing condition,</i>
<i>with all the rural deities about him, pitying his hard usage, and</i>
<i>condoling his misfortune.</i></p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thy sacred succour, Arethusa, bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To crown my labour, ('tis the last I sing,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which proud Lycoris may with pity view:&mdash;               <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">The Muse is mournful, though the numbers few.           <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Refuse me not a verse, to grief and Gallus due,         <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">So may thy silver streams beneath the tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmixed with briny seas, securely glide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sing then my Gallus, and his hopeless vows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sing, while my cattle crop the tender browze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vocal grove shall answer to the sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And echo, from the vales, the tuneful voice rebound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What lawns or woods with-held you from his aid,          <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Ye nymphs, when Gallus was to love betrayed,             <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">To love, unpitied by the cruel maid?                     <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Not steepy Pindus could retard your course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor cleft Parnassus, nor the Aonian source:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing, that owns the Muses, could suspend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your aid to Gallus:&mdash;Gallus is their friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For him the lofty laurel stands in tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hung with humid pearls the lowly shrub appears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">M&aelig;nalian pines the godlike swain bemoan,                 <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">When, spread beneath a rock, he sighed alone;            <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">And cold Lyc&aelig;us wept from every dropping stone.          <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">The sheep surround their shepherd, as he lies:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blush not, sweet poet, nor the name despise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the streams, his flock Adonis fed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet the queen of beauty blest his bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swains and tardy neat-herds came, and last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Menalcas, wet with beating winter mast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wondering, they asked from whence arose thy flame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet more amazed, thy own Apollo came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flushed were his cheeks, and glowing were his eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Is she thy care? is she thy care?" he cries.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thy false Lycoris flies thy love and thee,              <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">And, for thy rival, tempts the raging sea,               <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">The forms of horrid war, and heaven's inclemency."       <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Silvanus came: his brows a country crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fennel, and of nodding lilies, drown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Pan arrived; and we beheld him too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cheeks and temples of vermilion hue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why, Gallus, this immoderate grief?" he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Think'st thou that love with tears is satisfied?<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The meads are sooner drunk with morning dews,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bees with flowery shrubs, the goats with browze."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmoved, and with dejected eyes, he mourned:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He paused, and then these broken words returned:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis past; and pity gives me no relief:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you, Arcadian swains, shall sing my grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on your hills my last complaints renew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sad a song is only worthy you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How light would lie the turf upon my breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you my sufferings in your songs exprest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! that your birth and business had been mine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pen the sheep, and press the swelling vine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had Phyllis or Amyntas caused my pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or any nymph or shepherd on the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Though Phyllis brown, though black Amyntas were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are violets not sweet, because not fair?)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the sallows and the shady vine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My loves had mixed their pliant limbs with mine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Phyllis with myrtle wreaths had crowned my hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soft Amyntas sung away my care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, see what pleasures in our plains abound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The woods, the fountains, and the flowery ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As you are beauteous, were you half so true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here could I live, and love, and die with only you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now I to fighting fields am sent afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strive in winter camps with toils of war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While you, (alas, that I should find it so!)                    <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">To shun my sight, your native soil forego,                      <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">And climb the frozen Alps, and tread the eternal snow.          <span class="linenum">}<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Ye frosts and snows, her tender body spare!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those are not limbs for icicles to tear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For me, the wilds and deserts are my choice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Muses, once my care; my once harmonious voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There will I sing, forsaken, and alone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rocks and hollow caves shall echo to my moan.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The rind of every plant her name shall know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as the rind extends, the love shall grow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on Arcadian mountains will I chase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Mixed with the woodland nymphs) the savage race;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor cold shall hinder me, with horns and hounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thrid the thickets, or to leap the mounds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now methinks o'er steepy rocks I go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rush through sounding woods, and bend the Parthian bow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if with sports my sufferings I could ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or by my pains the god of love appease.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My frenzy changes: I delight no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On mountain tops to chase the tusky boar:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No game but hopeless love my thoughts pursue:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more, ye nymphs, and songs, and sounding woods, adieu!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love alters not for us his hard decrees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not though beneath the Thracian clime we freeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Italy's indulgent heaven forego,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in mid-winter tread Sithonian snow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, when the barks of elms are scorched, we keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Mero&euml;'s burning plains the Libyan sheep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hell, and earth, and seas, and heaven above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love conquers all; and we must yield to Love."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My Muses, here your sacred raptures end:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The verse was what I owed my suffering friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This while I sung, my sorrows I deceived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bending osiers into baskets weaved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The song, because inspired by you, shall shine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Gallus will approve, because 'tis mine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gallus, for whom my holy flames renew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each hour, and every moment rise in view;<br /></span>
